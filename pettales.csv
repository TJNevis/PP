She supervised everything, and let us know in no uncertain terms when we didn't do things according to her specifications. She was my baby cat, and followed me from room to room, and cuddled constantly -- except when there were people over, because she could cuddle with me any time, and strangers give cuddles, too. She didn't really much like her sister, especially when she sat on top of her, but she tolerated her because Ophie wasn't the brightest kitty and didn't know any better. She hated canned cat food, and would shred all the toilet paper or paper towels on a roll so that she could drag it over and bury the canned food to show her disapproval. She always knew when I didn't feel well, and would immediately curl up on top of whatever hurt and purr as hard as she could. At the end, she could tell my husband needed cuddles more than I did, so the last thing she did was struggle to get up so that she could get on his lap. As soon as I put her there, she curled up and was satisfied. Love you, piglet. You won't be forgotten.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\13\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\13\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\13\story_pic3.jpg,,,,,,,,-1

Unless, of course, you wanted to rub her belly -- she would lie still for an hour or more and brave all manner of dangers for belly rubs. I never would have expected her to be the trooper that she was over the last month of her life. All the pills and vet visits and more pills, and she never once bit or scratched me, came to me trustingly almost every time I said her name, and was always willing to purr and be cuddled, no matter how much I poked and prodded her and no matter how terrible she felt. The very last thing she did was let me curl up with her for about half an hour and pet her very gently. She mustered a faint little purr for me, but I knew she was ready to be done.I like to think she's harassing her adopted sister Casey Jones somewhere, now. They bickered all their lives, but Ophie was never the same after Casey went, and I think she missed her bratty little sister.Take care of each other, girls.

15,-1,Jacki & William,Hill,blueyedmama@earthlink.net,Largo,Florida,Velvet,1996,2008,A frisbee in the sky,"Velvet HillAKA Ween, Monkeyface, StinkyVelvet, Born November 18, 1996, a beautiful mix of Black Lab, Rottweiler, Pit Bill and an enormous attitude and grace.From the day she was brought home as a wedding/house warming gift, she has filled our home with laughter, joy and more laughter.  Not a day goes by that we don’t see a picture of this beautiful part of our family and grin for she brought the word princess to life like none other could.Spoiled is not the word to describe this precious spirit, fulfilled and adventuresome describes the life for her to a tee.  Velvet swam amongst alligators, hiked at Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs and guarded many of tents for us in Ocala.  This girl could outrun anyone or anything and expected nothing less than more of it.  The Frisbee, well this invention was her favorite.  A Frisbee will never look the same to us again.  Her eyes lit up like the sun when the Frisbee came out to play.Smart would be another way to describe Velvet.  Words had meaning to her and her only.  The word critter we came up with to just rise her up to get her going.  We usually associated it with some kind of stuffed toy.  Her favorite toy was always the green hippo (we called it the hippotatamus).  That toy eventually got so disgusting but it was all hers and she did not mind as long as it was close by to her.  The word started taking on a new meaning when we pointed to trees when it said it.  She started attacking trees and eventually started trimming the branches for us.  LOL  The word shower or shirt usually made her growl.  We never knew whether it was words starting with SH or just the words in general.  We had to start spelling those words especially shower to get her in the bathtub.  We think she figured it out anyway because the trip to the tub had to include her leash.  One of her most interesting quirks was her whine that sounded like a monkey talking to other monkeys.  She knew she was a dog but when we started hearing her whine for toys or to go outside to do her business, we added another trade name of Monkeyface.  Her ears also flopped down in such a way that we swore they looked like bat wings.  We tried to add another trade name to the millions of Bat Girl but well she knew what the word BAD was and I think her ears were just hearing the BA part of it and always looked down like she was in trouble so that name of Bat Girl never stuck. With all her adventures, she ended up injuring a knee and developed severe arthritis in her knees and hips when she turned 7.  Such a young age but with the miracle of veterinarians and prescriptions for pain and her willingness to just keep trucking she kept on going like nothing was happening.  She is one tough girl, had to be to get used to a Rhodesian Ridgeback we brought home that was double her size.  All through this nothing could stop the lab in her and her wanting to play 24 hours a day.  We have never felt that kind of love until she came into our lives.  There will never be another Velvet.  There is only room on this earth for a spirit as huge as hers.  The love will never ever die…….  We love you Velvet….Jacki and William Hill",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\15\story_pic1.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\15\story_pic2.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\15\story_pic3.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\15\story_pic4.jpg,,,,,,,-1

Over the years to come she grew up into a beautiful Dalmatian. Amber was my kid, by buddy, my best fiend. She enjoyed going for rides, she loved to chase the birds at the beach and she LOVED to eat oranges with my dad. I could have not asked for a better friend than my Dalmatian. She knew when I was not feeling well or had a bad day at work. When I was not in the mood to play with her, she would just look at me with those BIG brown eyes and then it was like magic all my problems went away. She had unconditional love for me. She was a clown. That is how she got the nick name of “hambone”, she was just that a ham….she seemed to enjoy having her photo taken. She would seem to pose for it. She was a champ at the mutt derby races at Derby Lane. She came home with trophies and ribbons for racing. Then Amber became a big sister to a small Jack Russell Terrier. Her name is Sadie Mae. Amber and she were the best buddies ever!! They were like one. Sadie became Amber’s eyes and ears. Amber started to loose some eye site, so Sadie was her guide dog. Sadie would run and wake Amber up and let her know I was home from work and they both would come out and greet me with big brown eyes and their tales wagging!!! She had an active life, she had a good life, until one dreadful day. I noticed that Amber was getting a little slow in her walk. She just started to take a downward spin. So I had to come to terms with making a decision that I did not want to make. Sadie and I slept on the floor next to Amber her last night with us. The vet came to my home and gave Amber the shot. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make on my own. But I know in my heart it was the right thing to do for a friend that could no longer jump and run like a puppy. That is no way for a dog to live. Amber came home in my arms, as a pup and she went to sleep in my arms as a dear old friend. Amber I feel that you are running and playing just like a pup again, and I am sure you are eating oranges with my dad. There is a dog prayer that ended like this: My friend, when I grow old and am deprived of my health and sight, do not turn me away from you, rather see that my life is taken gently, and I shall leave, knowing with the last breath I draw that my fate was always safest in your hands. Amber you are sadly missed, and loved. You are not forgotten.

Si made it very clear in the first five minutes that you don't get within ten feet of his treat, while Rocky was equally adamant about not even looking in the direction of his ball/chew toy/bone/whatever. Yeah, it was gonna' be all for one and one for all.Actually, it did end up something kind of like that.  Rocky would lie on the floor--ten feet away--peering under the sofa and across the room as Si ate his breakfast in the kitchen. Si would generally leave one--maybe two--kibbles of hard food in the dish and walk away, a symbolic gesture to his companion that it was OK to venture out. Rocky never did return the favor by letting Si look at his toys. Even so, he clearly became accustomed to sharing the space when he would voluntarily rest on the floor next to Si.Both of our boys passed within four months of each other. We like to imagine their current partnership as one of enthusiasm and success--but in reality we know the old rules are likely still in effect:  not within ten feet and don't even think about looking this direction. Rocky  and  Si--two for the road, two in our hearts. ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\21\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\21\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\21\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\21\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\21\story_pic5.jpg,,,,,,-1

Three months before we heard she had lung cancer Nala and I had just started a routine.  Every time I would try to make my bed she would run in and jump on it, then she wouldn’t get off.  After we put her down we took her to Pet Passages to get her cremated.  The day we picked her up, her box came in a bag that had a paper with her paw print on it, a poem called the Rainbow Bridge, and a little thing about a necklace.  I got the necklace for Christmas and haven’t taken it off because it reminds me to keep her close to my heart.Thanks to Mr. McQueen and the staff of Pet Passages I have a smile on my face every time I think of her.Nala was a wonderful cat and beloved part of our family.  She was friendly with everyone but she had a special bond with our daughter.  They grew-up together.  She would follow our daughter around everywhere.  Our daughter could dress Nala up, carry her like a sack of potatoes, and make her sit through a tea party.  Nala didn’t care so long as they were together.

He meowed every time I walked by, and stared at me with these huge eyes.  I couldn't resist taking him home with me.  He was feisty and affectionate and seemed to understand every word I said to him from day one. He learned to be extremely obedient for a cat at a young age, and listened very well. He let me know when he wanted in, or out, and definately ruled the roost.  He let me know when he was hungry, thirsty, or when he simply wanted attention.  He had his own special way of communicating to me.  He listened to me when I was sad, and comforted me.  He always made me smile, with his crazy human like antics.  When I laughed at him, he'd nip my arm to let me know that he did not appreciate it. When he had to go to the Vet, he'd put his front paws around my neck like a baby and hold on for dear life. My Ruben was with me for many years, through thick and thin, and always by my side.  He was a beautiful,loyal and majestic companion and I will never forget him.

She was very smart, curious and full of energy! She had her very own room with plenty of exploring space, tons of toys and even her own baby grand piano which she loved to thump the keys on. She was a very special angel and kept me on my toes! She loved to help me sew and inspected all of my fabrics. She was very sweet and playful. She developed adrenal disease and after several years, her medication was not working anymore. Surgery was way too risky and out of the question.

He was only 4. He was diagnosed with stage 1 lymphoma in late December. We immediately started treating it however it was the aggresive type and we made the decision to let him go February 17. It was the only thing to do as the tumors were pushing on his throat and he could not breath. We didn't want him to suffer and our only other option was to give him a trach tube while we waited to see if the strongest chemo out there would work. That would be suffering so we said lets let him go.It was the hardest thing in the world espcially because he was such a love bug and so young. I miss him soooooooooo much.

Especially his friendly butt wiggle. He loved everyone (in his eyes there are no mean people or animals).

Some say dogs are special, man’s best friend,   your partner and your defender. Ruby was in a class of her own. Even those that are not “dog-lovers” loved Ruby. She will be missed by so very many. A gift to Danielle from her daddy when Dani was 7, Ruby became part of our lives.  Back then Ruby fit in a tote bag and we could take her to visit daddy at work. That did not last long and Ruby later took on the roles of horsey, blankey, dolly, therapist, playmate, pacifier (to our cat, no-less!), buddy and many others.While incredibly intelligent, Ruby was not the most disciplined dog. She certainly had a mind of her own. The first time we took her to PetSmart she grabbed a pig ear right out of a woman’s hand. The woman just looked at her and smiled as did everyone when they met Ruby. But when she wanted a treat at home she was more than happy to sit, shake, and speak, for it. Ruby would sometimes run out of the house and down the street and it took us (not so smart) humans a few times to realize that she would always outrun us and not to chase her.  We learned it was much easier to get in the car and offer her a much-loved car ride. Boy did she know how to get what she wanted! Ruby was so very polite. Our cat Sammy would “nurse” off of her and Ruby-Gal would just lay there and let him. When our other dog, Joey, came along she always let him go first. Ruby could be at the back door asking to come in and Joey could be on the other side of the house and he would beat her in the door. This also applied to going out. It now takes Joey some time to get outside as he keeps coming back in looking for Rubes…  He misses her so!Ruby could always tell when you weren’t feeling well. When Danielle had surgery on her toes, Ruby laid with her head carefully positioned between her feet for hours. When Joshua had his operation last year, she watched over him for days. At night Ruby would lie in the hallway between the kid’s rooms in case one of them needed her. She could not possibly choose between them. She licked away many tears and was so very attentive to all of us.Ruby has been through a lot over the years. She endured two torn ACL’s, cancer, hypothyroidism, meat allergies, becoming deaf and slowly going blind. What a trooper!  She handled her many surgeries, being forced into vegetarianism, wearing a cone far too often, and taking daily medications better than any human could. Thank you, Ruby for going through so much and handling it so well. It is so greatly appreciated.When we found out Ruby was so very ill we knew we must let her go but wanted to bring her home so we could spend one last night with her. Our veterinarian gave her something for the pain and we got Ruby her favorite (non-vegetarian) steak treats and tried to make her as comfortable as possible.

47,-1,Charles,Padilla,charlesp@rt66.com,Santa Fe,New Mexico,Sammy Padilla,,"April 7, 2008",My Beloved Son Sammy,"How My Son Sammy Came Into My Life:  I rescued Sammy from the side of the road on the outskirts of Santa Fe one Sunday afternoon (February 14, 1993).  As I passed you, I looked in the rear view mirror and you were looking at me as I passed.  I pulled off to the side of the road and honked my horn.  I opened my passenger door of my car and you came running as fast as you could and jumped in the front seat and sat right next to me all the way home.  You licked my arm and face as if you were thanking me for rescuing you ... but we rescued each other that afternoon.I advertised in the local paper for two weeks that I had found “you” and if anyone was looking for you … no one responded.  I contacted the local animal shelter and they advised me to bring you in … but I told them I wanted to keep you.  I had to do all the paperwork and pay the fees … YOU then became MINE.You loved to go riding with me in the truck and sat ever so proud on the passenger seat.  You would sit like a human and watched everything and anything around you.  People would point and say that you were “cute” … and YOU were.  I will never forget the first time I took you to the family property up in Northern New Mexico.  You had never seen a cow …. and you bolted after one and ran right under its belly.  The cow jumped up and kicked … but thankfully you did not get kicked.  I ran and got you and put you back in the truck.You were with me everyday of your 15 years – only when I was on vacation – and when I returned – boy, did you tell me off in your own doggy language.  I missed you the entire time I was on vacation, though and could not wait to be back home so I could hug and kiss you and have you right next to me on the bed.  Sammy, my son, you gave me 15 wonderful and fantastic years and I will NOT forget any of them.The Last Year:  In the last year of your life, you were having such a hard time getting up to walk to go outside to use the bathroom .... so for the last few months I would put a towel under your belly to support your back-end and use your chest harness to support you from the front.  I did this several times a day and night -- even through the winter of 2007-2008 -- in blizzards of blowing snow -- and in the early morning hours -- I would help you walk or carried you to go outside so that you could smell the trees and plants and do your “business.” Then it got even harder for you to walk – even with my help.  I would tell you it was “ok” to pee and poop on the pamper blankets I had bought --- you hated it – I know – but you finally would pee and poop and I would carry you to the shower and bathe and clean you all up.  I did this for several weeks – but you just kept getting worse.  If I could ... I would still be doing everything for you because of our love and affection for one another.I made the heart-wrenching decision to let you go on Monday, April 7, 2008.  That will be the worst day of my life.  At 9:20 a.m., as I held you in my arms, you went to Rainbow Bridge.  I kept whispering in your ear that I loved you … over and over and over again until you had passed.  When it was over, I looked down at your face and I saw a tear in your eye and I knew you were going to miss me … BUT, my son, I was the one who was going to miss you with all my heart and soul.  Ever since that day, my son, I cry when I get home or when I read all the wonderful postings people have left for you and me.  You are my guardian angel and I am so thankful that you and I rescued each other that Sunday afternoon and that no one was looking for you and you became MINE forever.

At the end of 5th grade, the teacher asked if anyone wanted Triple, as she could not care for him anymore, so I went home and asked my dad if I could take Triple.  Dad said, you better do all your research and find out what they eat, how to care for them, and then your gonna have to ask mom.  I thought, great, there is no way my mom is gonna let me have Triple, but I really loved the little guy, so I did the research and asked mom (I don't think my dad or my mom thought I would actually do the research), she looked at me, then at dad, and said, okay, but you have to take care of this guinea pig.I brought Triple home at the end of the school year and even though my mom and dad were hesitant at first, it only took about 2 minutes until they were totally in love with this cute, tri-colored (hence, the name Triple) guinea pig.  Before I knew it, Triple wasn't my little fatso anymore, he was mom and dads baby.  Mom went so far as to custom build a suitable (huge two story) home for Triple, everyone in the family calls it piggy palace.  It sounds crazy, but this little fatso as he was so lovingly called, had one heck of a personality.  He loved listening to jazz music and would purr, yes purr when he heard it.  He would even purr when we were petting him.  He would squeel whenever he heard the refigerator open because he knew there was always something tasty coming his way.  Triple was with us for a very short three years, but in that time he brought us a lot of joy.

If he taught me anything, it was to enjoy each day and approach it as if it were the beginning of something new and wonderful.  Always an optimist, he enjoyed being around people.  That was enough for him.  We moved many times while Mikie was part of our family and he was a trooper.  He looked at each move as an adventure.  He loved to chase squirrels but would never hurt another creature.  The birds in our yard were actually used to having him there and wouldn't fly away when he approached.

Bad people and upbringing is what makes for a bad animal.  Bubba is living proof that Pit Bulls just want love and give you back just as much.  My daughter brought him home to us after taking him away from bad people who abused him and wanted him to be a fighter.  He even had a different name and we wanted to protect him from that bad life.  Bubba was about a year old and he fit in perfectly.  He was a little strange about walking on tile but I fixed that with rugs on the floor everywhere he went.  He didn't like loud noise so when surround-sound was on, Bubba would just go to bed and then come in and check on us every once in awhile.  Bubba was well-known for liking DQ swirl vanilla ice cream - he had a hard time sharing with anyone.  Chloe, Dalmatian/Pit cross, was his favorite love...they were friends from the beginning and he always protected her.  He loved to play with Abby, Chihuahua/Terrier cross, and even though he could take one good bite out of her, he only mouthed her in play.  We have very fond memories of Bubba that will live with us forever.  He sits in the living room on top of a mantle, sitting on a piece of rug and wrapped with his favorite monkey.

But back to Meece...you couldn't even spell in front of her without her knowing what you said!  She was just so Meece about everything...happy, loved everyone and everything.  She had a severe reaction to a rabies shot when she was three and was on life support, her lungs collapsed and the vet bill was huge....but I brought home a live dog and we had her for 10 more years.  I didn't get Clare to replace Meece but I believe Meece is up There Over the Rainbow telling Clare, Do this, she really likes that!  I registered Clare as Just Clare because I didn't want to compare her to Meece...but Meece is still with me through Clare and makes me laugh every day.  All of my friends and relatives knew and loved Meece...she was just that kind of a dog...100% pure love!

A lion dog by breed but all during his little life, he was king.  That is how he got his name, after the Lion King Movie. Simba ruled and not always gently.  My daughter and best friend can attest to that with the scars on their noses from invading his space and several electric company employees can attest to being chased out of the back yard by him. He came to me on Easter, 15 years ago.  He was a gift from my younger son, who acted as his midwife, when he was born.  He walked into my life and we have been inseperable ever since. Now, understand he wasn't your usual pampered pooch, although he could have been.  Before he was a year old he had learned how much fun it was to invade rabbit nests and how much fun it was to shake and through up in the air the babies.  I remember one Sunday morning glancing out the kitchen window looking at him playing with a white object. When I went out to check on him, out of the corner of my eye ran a good size rabbit without it's tail. Simba had that in his mouth.  He loved swimming with the grandkids in the wading pool in the back yard and frisbees were his favorite toys when he was young.  He gave comfort to me during a terrible divorce and later helped me find the love of my life six years ago while walking him.  We will all miss him.  His heart was bigger than all outdoors.  He watched over my father when he came to live with us in his golden years and watched as all ten grandchildren were born and subsiquently we have four living with us now which I am sure tried his patience on many levels.  Through it all he was loving and gentile with all, quite the care giver, checking on his clan as each came and went to see if all were O.K. He just loved giving kisses and sharing toys with other dogs. His spirit will truely live on. Thank you dear Lord for giving me him.  How very, very blessed I have been. He was my true companion.

Archie didn't seem to mind - he was always happy go lucky. As long you gave him food and took him hiking you could call him anything.  I've had Archie since he was 12 weeks old. He was a Corgi that loved to swim, he may have been part fish. I don't know how those little legs held him up, but he took every opportunity to get wet.  His way of showing he was excited was to hop up and down on his front legs and make little barking sounds.  The only things that seems to get him upset were sneezes and he would run full speed from anywhere in the house or outside just to run up to the person who sneezed, bark at them, then return to whatever he was doing. He had his run-ins with the vet too - two bowel surgeries for eating non-food items.  I called him my $7000 dog.  Since moving to New Mexico his favorite words besides hungry? were, Ready to go hiking?  He knew so many words, but those were his favorites.  He took it upon himself to keep all birds, aircrafts, hot air balloons, etc. out of the airspace of the backyard.  Four years after moving away from a neighbor that had a dog named Sam, if you mentioned the name, Archie would still run around looking for him and barking.  But what Archie was famous for was licking.  He did full on lick sessions if allowed, if not he did walk by licks on the legs and toes.  One quick swipe of the tongue on each leg or foot and just keep walking like nothing had happened.  He loved summer when there was so much skin and so little time...Archie died doing what he loved - hiking.

Every time he would stand straight and tall and wag his tail , and look at me with those big brown eyes , and I would ask him if he wanted to go home !  he said yes !! :} so I told the lady at the counter and off we went !! home to meet the Wife ! HE ALWAYS LOVED HER !! that was 95 . 14 years later I have lost my best friend ,we did everything together !!! we used to walk every night  down joe's creek, he would start pacing and bugging me about sundown , time to go for a walk !! We lost him July 25th of 2009, to Cushings Disease. It was very hard for me, I guess I was being selfish , not wanting to let go of my Duker He was stumbling and lathargic in the final days , And we finally made the choice, as he just got worse everyday. I could not stand to see him suffer anymore . It happened all so fast , we were just out walking one minute , then 2 weeks later, I found myself picking him up off the floor .  WHAT HAPPENED ??? So the last night I grilled a big fat T-Bone steak for him. DUKE DID GOOD !!! HE ATE SOME OF IT, I spent the last night on the floor sleeping  with him, he would get restless and wonder about in the night , so I stayed with him the last night before we put him down. It was the hardest thing I have had to do was to put my dog to sleep. He Was and still is my buddy !  I MISS YOU DUKE !!!",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\65\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,-1
68,-1,Marie,Legrand,mtlegrand@gmail.com,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Leo the Lion-Hearted,,"August 12, 2009",Leo: A Cat Beyond Compare,"I brought Leo home as a nine-week old kitten, as a natural companion for his twin brother Oscar, whom I had adopted from a friend the week before.  I quickly realized, however, that while Leo and Oscar looked exactly alike, Leo's personality was all his own.  Leo was an alpha cat, a fearless leader, a skilled hunter, a daring explorer, and the most loving and affectionate cat I have ever known. Although he spent much of his time taking long, luxurious naps in various locations around the house, Leo packed his waking hours with adventure and excitement.  He was a great jumper and climber, and could easily jump four feet in the air and into a kitchen cabinet, sticking the landing every time. Leo loved to hunt big bugs, and especially enjoyed moth season.  Leo would let me lift him up high above my head so that he could get at moths on the ceiling, and would bat his front paws at them while I held him tight at the waist.  Many moths met their tragic end as a result of our joint hunting technique.  In addition to his supreme feline jumping and hunting abilities, Leo had many dog-like qualities, and enjoyed playing fetch with various toys.  Leo also had excellent problem-solving abilities. Last Spring he figured out how to use his paws and claws to lift the floor heating register covers, and once he had removed a cover he would crawl down into a heating duct as though it were a hidden cave that needed exploration.  Fearing for Leo's safety (and relieved that he hadn't mastered this trick in the winter when the furnace was on), I placed large rocks on top of the floor registers, figuring that would put an end to the heating duct exploration, but I underestimated Leo's tenacity and ingenuity.  While I was at work, Leo perfected the art of throwing his entire body weight against the rocks in order to move them out of his way, once again lifted the register cover out of the floor, and proceeded back down into the heating duct.  This time, however, he managed to claw a nice big hole into the duct, and ended up in the crawlspace beneath the house.  He then found his way through the crawlspace and into the basement, which is where I found him when I got home, patiently sitting on the top basement step, awaiting my return.Leo was extraordinarily friendly, and enjoyed greeting all visitors to “our home” at the door, where he would quickly begin sniffing their hands and shoes.  If the guest was a woman with a purse, Leo would stick his entire head into the bag to determine its contents - sometimes pulling out items that he knew were obviously toys for him to play with - things like hair elastics and grocery receipts.  Leo particularly liked guests with short hair, as he enjoyed jumping up on the sofa back behind these guests and running his paws through their hair.  I frequently had to explain to Leo that most people did *not* enjoy this type of head massage, no matter how well-intentioned it may have been.Leo was very sympathetic around people who were sick or injured, and would gently pat my face with his paws when I had a sinus infection.  He would also give me a firm head-butt when I was upset, and I knew that he was saying come on Mom, it's not that bad, whatever it is ... I'm here for you.  He liked to sleep in the bed with me, sometimes putting his head up on the other pillow and stretching out like a person.  Occasionally I would awake to find that Leo had fallen asleep in the crook of my arm, like a baby.  Leo also like to look me in the eye, and would jump up on high shelves and window sills when necessary to accomplish this. He needed a lot of love and affection, and would get in my face, purring madly, until he received the hugs and cuddling that he required.  Leo generally liked to be on the scene and would sometimes perch on the edge of the bathroom sink while I washed my face and brushed my teeth.    Leo was a wonderful brother to Oscar, and led Oscar on many adventures around the house.  Leo's personal grooming habits were not the best, and Oscar (who is a fastidious groomer with beautiful, gleaming fur) would often give Leo a bath after he had finished with his own.  Although they occasionally fought, as brothers will - wrestling on the floor over some perceived slight or disrespect - Oscar and Leo also enjoyed cuddling together for naps and hunting insects in a tag-team fashion not often seen among cats.   Leo - Oscar and I miss you terribly.  I used to tell you that when they made you, they broke the mold, you were a cat beyond compare.  Oscar and I agree that the house is awfully quiet without you around, and we wish that you were here with us, creating excitement and bringing us joy.  But we are certain that you are off having a good time somewhere, spreading the love and also watching over us.  You are gone from our sight, but never forgotten.  We will always love you.     ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic5.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\68\story_pic6.jpg,,,,,0

77,-1,Jessica,Attridge,Jbattridge@gmail.com,Marion,New York,Honey,,2-09,For Honey,"For Honey When it's time for goodbye. This is probably actually not my blog to write, but Jessica's. But I'll do it anyway. If any of you are dog people like we are, you will understand this blog. It's for the little pitbull that could, and Jessica's best friend Honey. Pits and other bully breeds are often throwaway dogs and usually suffer a fate that they don't deserve at the hands of humans. For years, both Jessica and myself have loved and owned difficult and dominant breeds because the very things that other people misunderstand about them, are the things that we love the most. The loyalty without bounds, the intense spirit, the need to protect the people and things that they love. Something that we can both relate to. The biggest scapegoat of any of these breeds is the pit or amstaff. If any of you have owned one of these breeds or even a mix of them, you know that there is nothing quite like the love that they can give. Honey was the embodiment of those qualities, packaged into a pocket sized bundle of love that often forgot exactly how small she was. Jess got Honey from a less than ideal situation when she was just a tiny pup. I was the first person to get to visit her, when Jess tucked her into her pocket and brought her to the pet store that I used to work at. This was the first of many visits to the store to see Auntie Donna and get holistic food and treats in an effort to make up for the disadvantages that the little girl had suffered in the first few weeks of her life. It didn't matter how long had passed since I had last seen her, Jess would only have to tell Honey to find Auntie Donna and soon I would have 30 lbs of little pit barrelling towards me from whatever end of the store she happened to be at. Whether I was in the fish room, or in the back that little dog never failed to find where I was. Usually dressed in some ridiculous outfit, I can still see her running full speed ahead with her little bat ears at attention, smiling the trademark pitbull smile. If I came to visit, Honey was all teeth, barking ferociously and trying to be 30 lbs of pure terror. Until of course I made it in the door, and she would launch herself at me doing the best she could to try and crawl inside my pocket. Because that's what she was, a pocket pitbull that couldn't get enough love and attention and was always ready for more. A few weekends ago, Jess and I went to go pick up her new car and Honey rode back with me to my house. She was my co-pilot in the passenger seat, sitting quietly just happy to be going for a car ride. It didn't take much to make her happy, and riding in the car and getting an ear massage was enough to be a small piece of puppy heaven. Honey was never well, despite Jess' best efforts to make her so. She never grew to full size, and from blood parasites to a heart murmur life did not hand her a good deal. But you would never guess it to look at her. She was best friend to Jess' daughter and to Jess. She gamely tried everything asked of her, and while it may not have worked right in the physical sense that little dog had a heart so big this world couldn't contain it. After days of mysterious seizures, friday Honey's story came to a close. Jess came home to find her seizing yet again and unresponsive. We rushed her to the emergency vet, but it was clear that there was no hope. It was time to do the hardest thing that we have to do for the animals we love so much and give them a dignified death. We said our goodbyes to Honey on a little couch in the emergency vet's office. But Honey wasn't there anymore. She was there enough to say goodbye, and there because that is what her breed is made of. Loyalty. She could not leave, until she knew that it was okay. She kept holding on, as long as Jess did. But for the most part, the little dog that could had already gone. Jess and I, along with one of her other friends gave Honey all the love we could while the vet gave the injection that would finally give peace to a puppy that never had a fair chance to begin with. Though she was not my furkid, it broke my heart just the same but there was no other place I'd rather be. I saw the start of the story of Honey and Jess, and I am honored to have been there for the end as well. Her heart got tired as they all do, but once again, what a heart it was. At approximately 8:25 pm Friday night, it beat it's last. She was only 2 years old. Having gone through a loss like this myself not so long ago, I know how much it hurts. And if I could make it go away, or take it back, I would in a second. But this is the best I can do. Some words for a little bat eared pitbull that gave more love in two years than some people can give in a lifetime, and for the girl that loved her just as much back. Because you can't throw away a life just because it's less than perfect. You love them by the minute, because you never know how many you will get. RIP Honey Safe trip babydog, safe trip Auntie Donna My best friend wrote this for my greatest heartbreak. I run a Pit Bull Advocacy group. I have seen many friends come and go in my life. But Honey....I fought for her from the 1st day she came into my life. She was my everything. But this little dog made a difference in so many peoples life. She changed the fear and ignorance so many people had for this breed...she made people smile working as a therapy dog. And she gave her all in everything she tried. She did this no matter how much she hurt and after going blind at 18 months old On her last day I begged her to leg go. She wouldnt let go...I had to make that choice for her. I held her will all I had as she crossed the rainbow bridge and she took a part of me with her. I will never stop missing her and I will never forget her.

You came to us 16 years ago so willing to leave the life of an outdoor kitty to live out your years in luxury as our first indoor pet. You are an icon for love as you came into my life the same time my husband did.  You have been through it all with me...a marriage, a new home, a second home, a first child and the most difficult challenge was sharing your very own space with the many foster kitties we helped to save.You never seemed to be bothered by the fact that you had to share your dishes, your toys, and bed space with the many less fortunate kitties that we brought into our home, many of which needed such extra TLC to restore their health.  I know more kitties became permanent residents than you had wished for and it may have seemed like your number one spot was filled, however we always considered you our favorite! You have given us 16 years of true joy.  The hardest thing was to watch you tire during these last few months. You gave us such unconditional love right until the end.  I know you struggled during your final days yet you continued to greet us, purr while on our laps and even tolerate our newest foster which was a 5 week old kitten.  For these things have added to our memories we will have of you.  Even after 25 years of animal rescue and the many heartaches I have gone through, the pain of saying good bye to you has hurt the most.

Daddy and Mommy were so looking forward to spending many more years with you.  What a precious gift you were to us all.  You came into our house and into our lives and changed them forever.  We’re so glad your home was with us… you made our house a home.  You were our glue, Buddy.  Three years and nine months is a small fraction of the time we were supposed to have together, and we can’t help but feel cheated.  But we also know that the joy you gave us is immeasurable, and that you enriched our lives every second we were with you.  From the second we picked you up, we knew that you had come to us for a reason. It seemed like you knew why you were here, because everything you did was for us.  You loved to please us as much as we loved to love you… such a beautiful soul.  You made us laugh, and you made us cry (tears of joy), and you helped us learn that patience will pay off.  You had patience with us every day… there was no such thing as a bad day with you. There are so many things you did that made you special, and we don’t want to forget a single thing.  It really didn’t matter what it was we were doing, because every day, every hour, every minute, we couldn’t believe how lucky we were to have such an amazing guy!  We feel so sad because we will not be able to do all those things with you again. We will miss playing ball and snuggling with you.  We’ll miss playing ball with you until you were exhausted… especially while the boys played catch in the street.  What a good boy you were for not going in the street!  We’ll miss our walks and rides, and seeing those beautiful pink ears in the window.  Whether we were leaving or coming home, you were there looking out for us.  We couldn’t wait to get home to you and we hated to leave you.  It has been such a pleasure to come home to you! You were always delighted to see us.  Coming up the stairs, ears back, circling around us to tell us how happy you were that we were home!  We always seemed to drive a little faster as we got closer to the house.  We never really knew how much we looked forward to coming home to you until you weren’t there. We could go on for 50 more pages, telling you how much we loved you and all the things you did. What we wouldn’t give to spend just one more day with you, and make it the very best day that we could ever have together… but we know that is not going to happen.  So for now we just have to think of you as much as we can, be eternally grateful for what you have done for us, and believe in our hearts you were needed somewhere else, and that your time with us was complete. Our hearts are so heavy, Buddy.  We can’t believe we won’t have another 10 years with you.  But you will be with us, in our hearts and as our little guardian angel.  We will see you again, Mr. P, and we’ll play and snuggle and walk and lounge, just like we used to do.  Your smiling face will live in our hearts forever.Until we meet again, all our love…Daddy and Mommy",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic5.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic6.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic7.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic8.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\79\story_pic9.jpg,,-1
80,-1,gerard,Ioannone,gerardioannone@yahoo.com,Rochester,New York,Barney Rubble,03/26/99,12/07/09,Barney Rubble,"Barney Rubble passed away peacefully December 7, 2009 after a brief battle with cancer. He was 10 years old. His sisters, Brandy Wine, Bailey Pup and Lil Brittany predeceased him. His human parents Gerard Ioannone and Kenneth Fairbairn, his brother Rocco Carmello, Grandma Mrs. Jean Shaw, and nbsp, special Aunt and Uncle Tom and Kay, many Aunts, Uncles, Cousins and friends, survive him.<br><br>It was a sunny Saturday in June, the 12 to be exact in 1999. Ken and I were on our way to the Laundromat as we had done so many times before on a Saturday morning. We pulled into the parking lot and we both saw this little puppy at the front door. Our Laundromat was on a busy 4-lane highway in Tampa. I remember telling Ken that I was going to get really pissed if one of our customers had just left the puppy outside in the parking lot only 75 feet from a busy road. and nbsp, <br><br>After entering the Laundromat, I questioned the patrons as to the ownership of the puppy. No one seemed to have any idea where he came from or who he may have been with. After spending all morning until early afternoon at the Laundromat, we decided to take the puppy home. He was a black and tan shepherd mixed puppy. He was funny, loving, playful and a little on the precocious side. On the other hand he was a little on the goofy side, reminded me of Barney from the Flintstones. When I mentioned that to Ken, we both instantly agreed that was to be his name. “Barney Rubble” and nbsp, and nbsp, <br><br>We immediately took Barney to the vet in Tampa, Flake Chambliss. After his initial examination, Dr. Chamblis decided that Barney’s birthday was to have been between March 25th and 27th. After putting the three dates in a hat, and pulling out one, it was decided that his birthday would be celebrated March 26. and nbsp, <br><br>Barney quickly became one of the family. In a matter of no time at all, big sister Brandy had him trained to the fact that she ran the household and he let her continue to think that. Brandy also became the mother hen to Barney. There were many a time when Barney would be asleep with his head on Brandy cuddled against her. and nbsp, Barney, Brandy and Bailey Pup played well together. They would run in the yard, mostly Barney and Bailey that is. Brandy would look at them with a “you two are nuts” look on her face. <br><br>As time went on, Barney became the fierce protector of our home. If he did not want someone to come in the house, they were just NOT coming in. Plain and simple. A little story comes to mind where Barney cost us about $125.00 for Girl Scout cookies. This little girl in a “Brownies” uniform came to the front door during cookie selling time. She rang the bell and I answered it. With the little girl was her baby sis, maybe 3 years old. As I was explaining to the “Brownie” that I had already bought about 20 boxes of cookies, little Barney decided to jump up on the screen door, growl, show his teeth and look the meanest mean he had ever worked up. In doing this, the little sister proceeded to pee her little panties all over my front stoop. I was a little mortified as her mother was at the bottom of the driveway. I quickly took the order sheet and ordered at least three of every variety. and nbsp, <br><br>As time went on so did our lives. Brandy then Bailey went to Puppy Heaven. Then it was just Barney and Rocco. Barney was not at all fond of his little brother Rocco. In fact, he would only play with Rocco outside. Inside he would growl, snarl and snap at him. However, if Rocco would get in trouble and get yelled at or worse yet get a spanking, Barney would run right over to see what was going on. I am not sure if he was concerned for Rocco or if it was just to make sure, he was the one getting in trouble... lol <br><br>Well as time went on some more we learned that Barney had a cancerous tumor. He was a brave soldier and was very much the Big Dog until the end. and nbsp, <br><br>To you our dear Barney. You will forever be in our thoughts and in our hearts. Until we meet at the Rainbow Bridge, know that we will always love you. <br>",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\80\story_pic1.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\80\story_pic2.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\80\story_pic3.JPG,,,,,,,,-1

I inqiuered as to how long do they hold one his age and was told until he gets gage crazy or becomes too sick to take care of.  With that I said I'll take him. I could not see him sitting in a 4 x 4 foot cage wating to go to a home.  We added Sir to his name and he turned out to be the most affectionate child I've known. (We don't have pets, we have chirldren)   He would sit in my lap on the recliner a extend hi paw for my hand and bring it in under his chin to sleep.  We could cradle him like a baby and he would perr and rub his head against our chins.  He had his sleeping spots on the couch and bed and would let you know if you were in them. There were times when I'ld sleep in the chair because he's in his spot on the bed, which was my wife's side, and she would be on my side.  he would wake up from a deep sleep and go charging into the kitchen whenever we were cooking with garlic. He must have been Italian.  Finaly, we had to let him cross over due to canser.  To this day, we make the bed and pull it down on one side in honor of him. We also leave a small light on for him to show him the way here if he ever wanted to visit.  I don't think we will ever find another freind like Sir Albert.   REST MY FRIEND, WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN ON THE OTHER SIDE. ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\82\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\82\story_pic2.jpg,,,,,,,,,-1

The man who handed me my newest rescue kitten was a childhood friend of my dad's.As we were adopted by additional canine and feline rescues, Bonita was teased by all. She was a very gentle, quiet cat who liked to keep to herself. The other cats picked on her often.

86,-1,Sharon,Willhite,MsRotts@aol.com,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Axel Beck-Ruiz-Hallam,,"January 13, 2010",Our Teddy Bear,"Our Dearest Angel AxelAxel saved my life.  In October 1997 I decided I didn't want to live anymore.  I was extremely depressed and lost all emotions for my family as well as the 3 dogs we had (a poodle, cocker spaniel and a retriever/chow).  I attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital for an extended period of time.  When I got out of the hospital I continued with the same mind frame.  My uncle would tell me daily You can die tomorrow but today you will live.  So, one day at a time I existed not wanting to exist.  Then in August 1998 someone handed me a 6 week old Rottweiler puppy who was born June 26th 1998.  Once I held the puppy something changed.  I decided that this puppy needed me and I needed him.  So, my entire focus was on this puppy.  I took him to puppy, novice and advanced school.  He also went to agility school.  Slowly, I started to have emotions again.  One day I found myself loving and caring about my family and the 3 dogs we had.  I also cared about life again and wanted to live.  Axel taught me how to love again.  I honestly don't know where I'd be now if it weren't for my uncle and Axel.  My uncle died 4 months after I got Axel.Every night at 6PM I would gather up all the dog toys and bones and would put them into a basket.  One night I was running late while reading.  To my surprise Axel gathered up all of the toys and bones one at a time and placed them into the basket.  I sat there completely amazed and laughed harder then I had in a long time.  After that night I would watch Axel go to the basket and take out some bones and toys, place them to the side and retrieve the one he wanted.  He'd put the others back before heading off with the one he chose.  He did this every day from there on.  Axel was a very amazing and intelligent dog.Axel had a special place in his heart for children and cats.  Axel loved his teddy bears.  He would treat them as if they were his babies.  He was very protective of his teddies.  Axel was a big teddy bear with a big heart.Axel loved me but he became extremely close to my older son and loved him dearly.  Axel came into our lives when he was 6 weeks old and lived with us until he was 2 years old.  Axel lived with a friend of mine because of his aggression towards the neighbors.  However, my friend and Axel did live with us for a year in 2006 to 2007.  My friend had Axel for 6 years.  My friend moved to a place that didn't accept Rottweilers so we got Axel back when he was 9 years old.  Axel became a man's dog.  When Axel came back to live with us he and my son became inseperable.  My son would walk Axel daily and sit on the porch with Axel for hours.  The loving bond between Axel and my son was amazing.  Axel was that once in a lifetime dog for my son. Axel started his life with us and ended his life with us.  The Good Lord knew where Axel needed to be for his last two years, with my son and the first home he knew.Axel was diagnosed with cancer January 2009 and given 2 months to live.  Axel's love and our love for Axel kept him alive until January 2010.  He was a real trooper and adjusted to life's new difficulties with the same love he always gave.  Axel started to lose his hearing over the last year and his puppy training of hand signals really helped with communication.  If Axel wanted to go out he would look at the door and throw his head up then look back at us as to say That's where I want to go.  He'd also do what I called the puppy dance which was so cute.Axel we miss you dearly and will always treasure the memories and laughter you brought to this family.  We were so blessed to have you as part of our family and our life.  Thank you for the years of protection and unconditional love.  Hold a place for us in Heaven Boy!!  We loved you once, we love you still and our dearest Axel Boy we always will.

89,-1,Sharon,Willhite,MsRotts@aol.com,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Ladi Bug Beck-Ruiz-Hirschfeld,,"November 01, 2008",Our baby girl,"Our Dearest Angel LadiLadi came into our home in July of 2000 when she was almost 3 years old.  We figured her birth to be around August of 1997 so we celebrated her birthday August 8.  Her original name was Lady Macbeth.  Ladi was given to a friend of mine in Colorado who asked me if I wanted her.  I wanted her but told him I couldn't take her because I had enough dogs already.  Naturally, he fell in love with her and decided to keep her.  However, while living in Colorado with my friend she became allergic to something in his house or on his property which caused her to get infections that almost killed her.  So, I decided to drive to Colorado to get her.  I had planned on driving up on Sunday but changed my mind on Saturday and drove up a day early.  While on my way to get Ladi I met someone on the road who later became my husband.  He was a truck driver delivering a load to Colorado.  Had I not changed my mind and driven to Colorado on Sunday I would have never met my husband.  So that Saturday brought me 2 gifts of love.Ladi was an instant bundle of joy.  She was so loving of everyone and everything that I decided to enroll her into becoming a Therapy dog.  She was amazing and loved going to nursing homes and hospitals to cheer up the elderly and the sick.  We also went to the Read to the Dogs program where children came to libraries and read to the dogs.  Ladi became my heart and soul.  She was gentle, kind and a very loving dog.  We became extremely close, inseperable.  I called her Ladi bug.  She even let all the other dogs in the house be above her in rank.Ladi was so special I decided I would like to have one of her puppies so I bred her in 2001.  One day I was out back with her and asked her How many babies are you going to have Ladi?  Immediately 13 popped into my head.  I decided to take her to the doctors and have an ultra sound done.  The doctor said she was going to have 8 puppies.  I told him she told me 13.  He said no he only saw 8.  I insisted 13.  I'm sure he thought I was a bit nutty.  The night Ladi went into labor we worked as a team.  She needed help with the first pup which was a male (who I have now, Levi).  After that she would give birth, wash the pup then use her nose to roll it to me while she gave birth again.  I would weigh and mark the puppy then hand the puppy to my son who would put it in the basket.  This went on throughout the night.  We delivered 12 puppies.  I kept waiting for the 13th one which never came.  I asked her where is 13, she looked at me funny, then I realized she was 13.  The next morning I took the puppies and Ladi to the doctors to be examined and the doctor was amazed how many puppies she had.  I laughed and told him Well I got my 13 babies.  It was a one time thing.  After she had her litter of 12 puppies I had her spayed.  She was an amazing and attentive mother.Ladi was very healthy and over the course of 3 days was gone on November 1 2008.  The doctors never did figure out what happened.  Her passing broke my heart.  Over the course of one's life you may own many dogs.  However, there is always that one special one that you bond with heart and soul.  Ladi was that special one.  My husband died September 26, 2007, 1 year and 5 days before Ladi.    Ladi Bug we miss you dearly and will always treasure the memories and laughter you brought to this family.  We were so blessed to have you as part of our family and our life.  Thank you for the years of protection and unconditional love.  Hold a place for us in Heaven Baby!!  We loved you once, we love you still and our dearest Ladi Bug we always will.

You were a gift from her husband not too long before he passed away and he gave her you to keep her company when he was called to leave this earth.  She cried so hard when I arrived to pick you up and take you into my home and begged me to take good care of you and if I could not, to please find you a good home.  Thirteen years later and 16 years old, you were still such a part of my life however I saw the pain you were in and the medical attention you were in need of.

95,-1,Shane,Gibeault,afangrywarrior@gmail.com,Hilton,New York,Milo ,,3/10/2009,Milo - My Guardian Angel,"I'll never forget the day I purchased Milo, I had bought him as a surprise for my wife and a companion to our toy poodle Bailey.  I told my wife to meet me at the groomers to pick up Bailey after work.  It was actually a surprise I was having Milo groomed to look nice for his new mommy.  When she arrived at the groomer I said well there he is and she looked at Milo (Also a toy poodle) and said You had bailey dyed white! .  From that day on we forged a bond with Milo stronger than any other dog I ever had.  Bailey developed a deep emotional problem with Milo and my wife so unfortunately we had find a home with only one owner and no other pets for him. It was either him or Milo and Milo hadn't done anything wrong, he was on all accounts the perfect dog.  As I said he was a present for my wife, but for some reason he attached to me and I got really attached to him.  For six years we were unseparable, he would even sleep with his head right on my pillow next to mine.  If I was at home, Milo was in my lap or following me wherever I went.  He was unbelievably good.  We barely had to train him, he potty trained really fast and he was good with everyone he met he just loved people.  For a small dog he was courageous too. A few years later we adopted a standard poodle (female).  One day they were in the yard playing after dinner while my wife and I were watching T.V and we heard a loud cry.  We ran to the back door and a male rottweiler had gotten off his leash and jumped our fence and was chasing our standard.  Milo drew his attention away from her to let her get away but wasn't fast enough to get away the the Rottweiler nearly took his hind leg off.  After the surgery on his leg he was never as fast or mobile as he used to be, he developed early arthritis and hard a hard time jumping on the bed or couch but he still had the same overly loving and attentive personality.  As long as you loved him, he gave himself up to you. He was the closest friend I had in the past 6 years, I told him anything and everything and he would never criticize or talk back.  He would just listen and then give you a big kiss to tell you everything was ok.  Milo was there while I served in the Air Force moving with us from State to State.  He was there each time we adopted a new dog that was never as good as him. He was there when my son now 3 was born and never became jealous and loved him just the same.  Now we have a void in our famiy that will be impossible to ever match.Milo was taken just one month after his 6th birthday, way too early.  We came home one night calling to him and usually he would have already been at the door waiting for me when he heard our car, but tonight was difference.  We went upstairs to see if he was sleeping on our bed but there was vomit and diarrhea everywhere on the floor.  I thought maybe he got sick and knew he was in trouble for going in the house.  When he knows he's in trouble for something he hides under the bed.  So I went to my side of the bed and sure enough saw his little tail sticking out from under.  I went to grab him and knew immediately.  He was stiff, cold and his tail wasnt moving.  I was breathless... I couldnt speak, our family pet was gone.  Milo had gotten into the trash that day and eaten something that killed him.  We're not sure if it was chocolate or something that had chemicals on it.  We found this site because Milo deserved a proper goodbye as any family member of ours.  He gave us his entire life to serving our family.  I can't say enough about our local pet passages Harris Funeral home in Irondequoit, NY.  They met us in the parking lot as we carried him in.  They prepared him in their viewing room for his funeral so that family could say goodbye to him.  They treated him like they would have any family member with great dignity.  We chose to have Milo cremated and will be keeping his ashes to keep him close to us.  We will never forget him.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\95\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\95\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\95\story_pic3.jpg,,,,,,,,-1

My son and I adopted Buddy on January 26, 2007 from the New Mexico Dachshund Rescue. He was chosen as a play buddy for our other dachshund-Bingo.  They were both 2 years old when we finalized the adoption.  They were best friends.  Buddy was born blind, but you could never tell that he was blind except by looking at his eyes. He got around the house and yard very well once Bingo showed him around. He was an amazing little dog.  Buddy was so playful and loveable. He was also the protector of the family.  He had the strong alpha male personality around male strangers.  Buddy loved to sleep in my bed and loved to hide under all the covers.  When I could not find him, all I had to do was look for a lump in my bed even when it was made. He could always be found there. Buddy ruptured a disc in his back. His hind legs were paralyzed and he lost control of his bowel and bladder. Over the next few days, he progressively got worse and by the time we were able to get him to the Vet he was not in good health.   On March 8, 2010, one day before my son’s 15th birthday, we made the painful decision to send him to heaven so he would not suffer.   He will be missed sorely by all who were lucky enough to ever be in Buddy's presence. He changed our lives in so many ways and gave us so much love in the 3 short years he lived with us. I will always remember him and I will love him forever with all my heart.  Buddy, we miss you dearly and will always treasure the memories, fun and laughter you brought to this family. We were so blessed to have you as part of our family and our life. Many hugs, kisses and love to you. Dear Lord, thank you for giving us our baby.

It was one of the hardest things we've ever done, having to let her go. She was sick with Cancer. Our little bouncy girl was tired. We could see it in her eyes.  My dad was the first one to greet her into our family he rescued her. He gave her to me, due to certain circumstances I could not keep her so I gave her to my cousins.  They then gave her to my mom. Where she spent he BEST last 3 years of life. I wish my mother could of had her longer. She was our family dog! We all loved her so much. So sweet and so precious so well behaved with the kindest eyes and soul. The most beautiful MinPin I had ever laid eyes on. She will be dearly missed.  I guess everyday will get a little better.

He was the love of my life. Our journey together came to an end on the evening of March 10, 2010. I always dreaded this day and always prayed that the Lord would take my boy when that time came so I wouldn't have to do it. The time came and I found strength to be with my boy until the end.

We picked him out after searching thru 100's to adopt. I really was not sure at the time I wanted another pet after loosing our other little Schnauzer but when I saw Darby, I knew he was the one to give a good home to.  He turned out to be the best little boy doggy anyone could want. When we adopted him, he was supposed to have a problem with toileting and we could not believe it.  Well it turned out he did not have a problem, he just needed the attention and someone to be able to recognize when he wanted to go out. We learned and he was perfect. Darby was an extremely affectionate little guy, loved to play and go for his morning and evening walks.  His pops would take him out come rain or shine every day.  Actually, Darby took him for the walk!!  Maybe a week before this happened Darby started behaving different, like not going his normal way on walks and not responding to his play time. We just took it as his peronality changing.  Then a couple days before this happened he started peeing on the floor inside, not lifting his leg or even responding. I was supposed to call the vet on Monday to get him in and checked and then on Saturday, March 20, 2010, Darby had a seizure.  We don't know what caused it. It lasted over 2 hours. After an IV and 2 vials of valium, he still would not come out of it and we had to make a decision. The vet felt he had a brain tumor. Even if I would have gotten him to the vets sooner, I don't think the vet would have even realized what was going on because of his age.   It is just so hard to believe we lost him and our hearts are broken.  We miss our baby so much and still cannot believe this has happened. We are having a lot of tears and emptiness for our boy. He was too precious and did not deserve to have gone thru what he did.  He had a lot of love and God will have him in heaven.

True to her breed, she had strong herding tendencies and would never hesitate to herd a person or other dog if she thought they were lagging behind and straying from her pack that she was in charge of. Rock solid temperament she was never aggressive with the hundreds of other dogs she was associated with.  She was a calming presence to many (both canine and human) who were always looking up to the Alpha of the group.Our years together were spent doing our volunteer work and spending time together just strengthening our bond.  My most favorite time was when she was with me being herself on walks, runs, hikes and visits to the beach and visitng her many friends she had.She saved her greatest gift for last.  She waited for me to return to her on the day she passed away.  I was able to hold her as she took her last breath.

My two son's and I got her in Florida. She's named after my Great Aunt Elva's dog.  They had the same color and disposition.  I never once saw Tootsie sad or angry.  She was docile, kind, and always happy. But that said, she did snore the loudest I have ever heard any dog (or human) snore. :) And of course, her favorite place to sleep was on the back cushion of the couch, right above my head. The TV would have to be blaring in order to hear abover her snoring and oftentimes she would wake herself up snoring, which was absolutely hilarious. She had horrible allergies, which I am sure was the cause of it.  She loved plush toys.  Our backyard is filled with them at the moment, because Tootsie always carried a different one outside with her when she went potty. I'm still struggling with having to go out in the backyard and pick them all up for the last time.  Tootsie died three days ago of a massive heart attack due to congestive heart failure.  It came on suddenly, without warning. Not having the opportunity to say goodbye is haunting me, even though I know she knew how much I loved her.  I was the only one she would kiss.  We snuggled, cheek to cheek, and she would snort with glee.  I'm going to miss that.  I wish I could have held her close to me, cheek to cheek, while she passed.  I regret I did not get that opportunity.Our Tootsie was loving, kind, considerate, forgiving, patient and joyous.  She was a dog and God-like in every way. I had a dream the night after she died.  My dogs were playing in a doggy park and I was trying to gather them all togehter.  As I glanced back, I did a double-take.  There was Tootsie, on a doggy jungle-gym, her tail wagging and her favorite red toy hanging out of her mouth.  She came to me in my dream to let me know she's Ok... and she's not suffering... she's happy again...and she's playing...

She had opinions about various things and wasn't afraid to share them, especially, opinions regarding food and playtime.  Sierra loved treats and would quickly remind when she should receive one.  She also loved playing fetch.  Often she would bring back one toy or ball with another one tucked in her mouth.  My favorite was when she would cock her head to one side as if to say, hurry up and throw the ball.  Additionally, Sierra was also the most loving dog I have ever met.  She was right by my side during a rather difficult time in my life, and I truly believe she understood my sadness and frustration.  I will never forget driving home one day with her head on my shoulder.  Such a simple gesture, but it was exactly what I needed.  She just knew.As much as I love Sierra, she wasn't just my dog . . . she was also my parents dog.  They lovingly took care of her for the past 7 years.  They spoiled her like a grandchild, made sure she was healthy and safe, gave her special treats (e.g., scrambled eggs on the weekends and McDonald's cheeseburgers on her birthday), and most importantly loved her.We are all blessed to have had Sierra in our lives, and I know we all miss her every day.  I am very thankful that I was able to be with her in the end, and I know she is playing freesbie in heaven right now.Love,Hannah",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\122\story_pic1.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\122\story_pic2.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\122\story_pic3.JPG,,,,,,,,-1

Adopted from the SPCA when he was a few months old, Frisky came into our lives. He was an incredibly intelligent and fierce, yet loving, cat.When he was young Frisky would fetch a ball made of aluminum foil and bring it back and drop it in a box. He would also drink from the toilet and chase lizards and squirrels. We are pretty sure Frisky thought himself a dog. Frisky loved to go outside and was quite the hunter, but because he didn’t have front claws, we always tried to catch him when he did get out, as we were afraid he wouldn’t be able to protect himself. Later, after he caught a squirrel, we realized we did not need to worry so much!  (Without front claws I consider this to be a pretty amazing feat) Lucky for the squirrel Frisky could not keep hold of him and he got away.He was always quite feisty and not afraid to show you how he felt. Frisky loved attention as long as it was on his terms. You couldn’t walk by Frisky without petting him – he would reach out with his paw and remind you he was there should you try to walk by without giving him attention. But if you petted him in the wrong spot, or stopped before he wanted you to, he would bite… just hard enough to let you know you did something wrong or that he didn’t want you to stop…Frisky loved to lie on anything warm. You could always find him on the DVD player, in front of the French doors, on the DVR or the back of the computer monitor. When we switched to a flat-screen monitor Frisky was not happy!

You could always find him on the DVD player, in front of the French doors, on the DVR or the back of the computer monitor. When we switched to a flat-screen monitor Frisky was not happy! He tried to lie on top of it but he just couldn’t fit.Frisky endured several additions to the zoo over the years but did not necessarily welcome them, especially the dogs. He tormented our dog Ruby when she was a pup and did the same to Joey when he came along. Frisky sometimes acted as if he wasn’t fond of the other cats but always played with them and occasionally you would find him grooming them. Rocko and Morticia will miss him dearly.When Frisky was about 12 he started to settle down. He quit trying to get outside and wasn’t so active at night. He became much more affectionate as well. He wanted to be near someone all the time, whether sitting next to them on the couch or sleeping with them at night.  While I’m sure it was mostly for warmth I like to think that he just liked our company. :)Along with our wonderful vet, Dr. V., we spent the last several weeks trying to make Frisky well. He rallied for some time but could not hold on. Frisky left us this morning, and while it makes us very sad, we are so happy he is no longer suffering. He lived a long life and we are so very grateful for every moment he shared with us.No heaven will not ever Heaven be, unless my cats are there to welcome me.~Author unknown",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\123\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\123\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\123\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\123\story_pic4.jpg,,,,,,,-1

130,-1,Susan,Lamphere,suelamphere@msn.com,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Angus,,10 July 2010,A Pup for All Seasons,"Angus was already a year old when he became a member of our family.  At the time we lived in Vermont, Angus was assigned to a pet adoption program and was currently living on a farm in Northern Vermont where his main pastimes included rolling in the new mown grass, chasing ducks and racing with his sister. A Border Collie/Labrador mix, Angus was well suited for the Vermont winter that was fast approaching.  Angus had not quite abandoned his puppyhood and still had a bit of growing to do. His sparkling brown eyes were full of mischief and he soon proved to us that, as young as he was, he had a strong will of his own.  As the colder weather drew on, his sleak black coat covered a layer of fluffy wool beneath it, which kept him warm during all the fun days to be had playing in the snow.  And he loved the snow! He would sniff the air, anticipating the impending storm.One of his favorite pastimes was snowboarding.  He would take the lid of the garbage pail and slide up and down the drive with my daughter, Helen, alongside.  Whey would have snowball fights and where the snow had drifted into deep mountains, Angus would dive into the drifts, jumping and pushing a trench through them.  After hours of play, both Helen and Angus would come inside, hair and whiskers covered in icicles, ready for a steaming mug of hot chocolate.In the spring, Angus would spend hours in the woods, sniffing the sweet new smells - and sometimes getting tangled up with briars and the occasional porcupine.  And, of course, there were encounters with the ever present squirrels who would run down the trees, taunting and teasing him,then scamper back into the leafy canopy whenever he made a run for them.  The squirrels brazenly stole his biscuits and toys and as fleet as Angus was, he could never quite catch them.  Once, I heard him barking and when I looked out I saw a squirrel pulling Angus' blanket out from his kennel.  In the summer, Angus and Helen would fill a backpack with  water and treats and hike up to nearby Stirling Pond where Angus would have a refreshing swim.  There was the annual trip to Maine to look forward to, paddling in the sea, ice cream cones and lobster sandwiches.  What a dog's life.The fall in Vermont is particularly beautiful and a cause for celebration.  There was Angus' birthday party, of course, and the annual trip to the apple orchard, organizing the pumpkin carving and bringing out his Bat-Dog costume ready for Hallowe'en.  As the nights drew in and we made our Thanksgiving and Christmas preparations, Angus was an indispensable helper.  He had his favorite turkey dinners, helped us trim the tree, hung up his stocking and even went shopping for Christmas gifts.But that was Angus - a puppy for all seasons, and how he made every season seem that much more fun and alive for us all.  Thank you, our darling friend, for the years of play and looking after us.  We will always love you and you will always be with us.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\130\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,0

My husband had just lost his beloved Sheltie (Penny) shortly before his birthday. I thought what better present then another Sheltie, not knowing how special she would become to all of us. After many phone calls to the breeder she finally told me on October 29th Which was my husband birthday that she had a female Sheltie for me. I drove to Honeoye Falls on the 29th and met the breeders (who I became very close friends with) and picked up Nittany. I brought her home in a blue crate (as one of the requirements were that she had to be taken home in a crate) Nittany never rode in a crate again. She preferred the front seat next to me. I brought her in the kitchen and opened the crate. I had made a sign at work ' Hi, I am Nittany your 50th birthday present. I called my husband into the kitchen. The first thing he did was pick her up and gave her a big kiss. The next day they watched Penn State on tv and watched Penn State for many years after that. By the way that is how she got her name Nittany. We had a male Sheltie named Boomer at the time I brought Nittany home. Boomer fell right in love with Nittany and they were very close until she died. Also, two years later I brought home another Sheltie from Nittany's breeders. We named her Valley as Penn State is also referred to as Happy Valley. Nittany and Valley went everywhere with us. Horse shows all over the Country. They were the perfect dogs. They were both show dogs in obedience and also registered pet therapy dogs. We did a lot of pet therapy for Hospice Visiting Nurse. They also were at his celebration of life and his church service. My journey with my Shelties is over. I will miss Nittany so much. She was always there for me. She even made the decision to die on her own terms. The last thing I asked her to do for me is when she gets to the Rainbow Bridge to give Doggie hugs and kisses to my husband and all the other Shelties and Horses that have passed. She took one last breath and died very peacefully. Before taking her to Harris Funeral Home, Pets at Peace, and nbsp,I let our three Corgis come in the living room to say goodbye to her. They smelled her and my young Corgi Julep licked her face. They were all very sad. Nittany was the alfa dog in our house and even though she was 14.5 they all respected her. I will miss her so much. Someday I will meet her at the Rainbow Bridge and we will all give hugs and kisses to each other. Nittany I love you so much and you are in a much better place.

Minion was born in 2001 to unknown, but undoubtedly royal, parentage. After  a one year unsuccessful stint with her first adoptive parents, Minion’s mother adopted her from the Humane Society. During her lifetime, Minion enjoyed many activities, such as jumping out of second floor windows, flying her spaceship to and from Planet Zebnar, acting out scenes from her favorite movie “Jaws” and playing her favorite games, “Kamikaze”, “Stampede” and “Upside Down Superman”. Minion especially enjoyed the installation of her microchip. Through this she could watch TV on the back sides of her eyelids, contact her mother at all hours of the day via email, radio transmission or smoke signals and surf the net. Minion was also a self-proclaimed musical genius. She not only claimed to have written lyrics to many popular songs, but she additionally maintained that she was a backup singer for System of a Down. Many people’s lives were affected by Minion’s wit, sense of humor and intelligence. If it were not for Minion’s expertise in areas such as personal income tax and civil procedure, her mother likely would not have finished law school. Although she claimed to be bestowed with a genius I.Q., one of Minion’s endearing quirks was that she had trouble with her spelling. She would often write notes to her mother that were besotted with typos and spelling errors. No matter how many times she was told that “bird” was spelled b-i-r-d, she would insist on spelling it “buhrd”. Most importantly, Minion was a loving and compassionate friend who gave her affection selflessly. Her mother will miss her immensely.Minion is survived by her loving adoptive mother and father, her reluctant cat sister, Sifu, her grandmother, her Uncles Brian and Albert and Aunts Joyce, Jean and Renee. She is also survived by her very close and personal friends Russell, Joseph, Admiral Parker, Hi Todd, Jess and Buddy. Services will be held on August 20, 2009 on Planet Zebnar. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her name to the Humane Society. ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\137\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,0

He started to show strange sighns. Anyway to make a long story shorter his behavior started to get more depressed and he started to limp and hwe had diaria.It started on Saturday night. we had to wait till monday to take him to vet. his health went down hill fast. He started to fall alot and could not get back up. by the thime monday came he was almost not able to get or walk very much at all. anyway jake had a ruptured disk in his back and lost all feelin in rear including bowl and urinary functions. The Our vet was very concerned. he gave us medicatuion and told us to make him rest and give him a lighter diet for three days till his diaria was better. it did get better. he sent us home to rest the dog and medicate him.

My husband was breaking his back liftng his 100LB rear dead weight to get him to go out to potty. he was not able to walk at all. so we called the vet again and told us to bring him right in so we did. WE discussed putting him down. We hated the idea but we saw that he was in very very bad shape his bladder was filling up because he could not feel he had to go because he could not feel. we were devustated we discussed it and we had to sleep on it. The next day the vet wanted to try cortizone shots to see if they woyuld help he was sceptical but we wanted to try.Well the worst thing ever happened that next day. we took him in for one more treatment. But the vet and staff convinced us to put him down. well we sure were not prepared for that! We made the disission without taking the last approach for him. So we ended up having him put down. One minute he was sitting in the rear of my car panting and smiling and enjoying the cool morning air. the next getting put to sleep.

We picked him out from a pet store in hopes to give him a better life but it turns out Benji would be the one to bring so much joy into ours. Benjamin was so much more than just a pet; Benjamin was a member of our family. Benjamin brought joy into our lives every day. One of my favorite things he did was when he would come running over when our other boys were out chasing him. Ben would jump up and hide on my lap for the longest time. Hiding under my laptop or blanket he would peek his little nose and eyes out to see if it was clear. He was such a little nervous guy when he first came home with us but as time passed he calmed down and turned into such a good couch snuggle buddy. Ben would sit beside you and let you pet him for what seemed like forever before running around and playing with his 3 buds.  His fur was so silky smooth and he had the two cutest black spots on his belly. Benji would run around for hours playing with his closest buddy Otis J. Perkins. They would steal paper (or anything else they could grab), pull many things under the couch, hide things in “the club” and then to end the day they would snuggle together in their hammock.  Benjamin was taken from us too soon but he will always remain in our hearts. We hope you are safe and have access to all of the “sprinkles” and “B” you could ever want. Thank you Benji Bear for all of the kisses, laughs, beautiful  ”songs” and memories you have given to us. You will be missed dearly Benji but you will never be forgotten.

When I made my decision to get a dog I knew I wanted a Rottwelier. I bought several books on your breed so that I could be the best parent I could. I read each book from the very front to the very back and the more I learned the more I wanted. I also learned of some not so good things as well. Things like how susceptible to cancer your breed is and that the Rottweiler’s average life span is 10. I dreaded these things but what could I do but to accept them if I wanted you. I accepted them and said to myself, if I can have you until you were 10 then I would be happy. I should have asked for 11. The day we met I never could have imagined how wonderful of a friend you would be to me. I could not have asked for any more special of a friend than you and I feel very blessed to have had you as part of my life. You taught me much my friend! I can’t believe the time has gone so fast and you are 10 and with cancer. My heart breaks but I knew one day that it would. I look back at the years and remember the countless great times we had together, I will hold them close to my heart, and those memories will never leave me until the day I shall die too.

He named her after his favorite car lexus , but spelled it alexus. Believe it or not her favorite toy was a plastic milk jug, or plastic pop bottle that she would throw up in the air and chase them around the house. As she grew she loved the family and played each and every day. She turned out to be a great watch dog and protector. We grew more each passing day to love her more and more. In the summer her favorite place was to be out on the porch or in the back yard. For a red nose pit bull she was the kindest loving dog anyone could ask for. At Christmas time she even had her own stocking filled wit doggie treats a flea collar , and dog toys. She was and always will be a family member. Jonathan would offten take her to the park with him to watch him and his friends play football. As the years went by jonathan niknamed her mama and often called her mama girl. This Christmas was different tho , Alexus became sick a week before the Holiday. The cancer acted and even though she ate and drank she still lost weight. She still til the end was a great watch dog and never gave up.

150,-1,Beth,Sholar,esholar@verizon.net,Tierra Verde,Florida,Maxwell,,1-14-11,My Best Friend . . .,"I wandered into the shelter in Allentown Pennsylvania wondering if a special little furry friend was there for me.  And you were, huddled in that little cage just waiting.  You came into my life snuggling under my chin as I held you for the first time because you needed love and were sick.  A common respiratory infection was simple enough for us to take care of together, but the shelter didn’t see it that way and your time was marked.  Luckily we found each other just in time.  I thought I saved you, but didn’t realize I would come to know how much you would truly save me.  Through all our time together we worked pretty well together, didn’t we?   You came home and with the right medicine you sprang into a happy life of nearly 18 fantastic years together.  Serendipity, a magical thing, brought us together and what followed, well, oh the times we have shared. Remember . . . . . . how when you got to feeling better you showed Madison who was king cat. Remember . . . how on moving day you hid on top of the duct-work in the basement in the twin house in Bethlehem, our first home together, and then in a rolled up rug in the new house when we moved to Danielsville because you were just so scared of the move.  You never did get used to moving (remember how you hid on top of the kitchen cabinets in the Norwalk apartment on moving out day?) but were always so happy to always be going with Mom. I would have never left you behind; never. Remember . . . how you loved the house in Vermont, hated the apartment in Stamford but rode back and forth like a trooper. Remember . . . how you were a Pennsylvania cat, a Connecticut cat, a Vermont cat, a Toronto cat, a Utah cat and, finally, a Florida cat. Well traveled you were! But I think you loved Florida best when you found you could be outside whenever you wanted, protected by the pool’s bird cage. You sure cleared out all the lizards in the pool area fast and brought all of your early catches in to Mom.Remember . . . how when I first got you, you were not at all sure that dinner was going to be a regular thing. So you pawed open the cabinet, ate a hole in the bottom of the food bag and just gobbled and gobbled as the food poured out. Your own little all-you-can-eat buffet! Remember . . . what a great traveler you were, plane or car didn’t matter as long as you got to go with Mom. Remember . . . how you loved the fireplace in Vermont and in Utah. Remember . . . how you learned to love drinking water from a glass in Utah and found joy forever more in getting your “drippies” from a water faucet. Remember . . . how you would literally dance in my lap to Sugar Sugar on the car radio. Remember . . . how you would put your paws up on the car door so you could watch out the window, especially when you were someplace you knew, like Wildwood or anywhere that shiny lights at night flashed by. Remember . . . how by the time when you were nearly blinded by cataracts you still wanted to have that look out the window just to see what you could see. Remember . . . how you loved your sun patch, could sleep in one for hours and couldn’t understand when the sun went down or when it rained why Mom couldn’t make it sun some more. Remember  . . . how you were a great bed snuggler and loved your place right in the middle. Remember . . . how on a morning every now and again, even after everyone was up and going, you’d still be in the sack on a particularly comfy patch still catching just a few more snoozes.Remember . . . how you snuck out of the house in Tierra Verde to go exploring and I came racing home from work to help find you, scared to death you didn’t know what the road or a car was. No one could find you or get you to come, but once I started calling for you, your little faced popped up from behind the front shrubbery to peek in the front window, scared of the big world. It was only Mom’s voice you wanted to hear because you knew it meant safety and love.  Remember . . . your adventure vacation to Key Largo and even after you had started to get sick you just loved traveling as long as you got to be with who loved you.You had so many special pet names . . . Maxwell Cat, Max Cat, Mr. Max, Bunny, Bunny-Bunny, Bun-Bun, Bunny Cat and even Bunny Rabbit Cat. You were oh, so loved and responded more to the sound of Mom’s voice than to any particular name, but you did know they were all for you but seemed to just love plain old Max or Bunny the best.You left my life like you came in to it, snuggling under my chin because you were sick. You escaped all the typical cat ailments that can cut a feline’s life short, but it seems there comes an age when no cat can outrun failing kidneys. And even though your kidneys betrayed you and your little back leggies just couldn’t go anymore, your little spirit to keep living and loving just couldn’t be dimmed.I am so sad a cat’s life cannot match the time of a human’s life. But I know we were really lucky to have each other for as many years as we did. Towards the end, as we nursed you and took care of the ailments that come with age, Dr. K said you were a miracle cat. I said you had a will to live because you knew you were loved. He said there was definitely something to that. But alas, the day came when it was just too much for your little body to overcome, even though your heart never tired and you tried to the end.“When I am old, or when I no longer enjoy good health, please do not make heroic efforts to keep me going. I am not having fun. Just see to it that my trusting life is taken gently. And be with me on that difficult journey when it's time to say goodbye.  Everything is easier for me when you are there. I will leave this earth knowing with my last breath that my fate was always safest in your hands.”I was with you, Max. I’ve loved and cherish every minute and blessed to have your life a part of mine. I love you, Max. Wait for me in heaven. I know I will see you there.MaxwellDearly Departed Best FriendAdopted: April 14, 1994Departed: Friday, January 14th, 2011",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\150\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,0

She was always wagging her tail, especially while eating! She was such a happy puppy that she would even wag her tail when she was getting into trouble. Millie was instantly loved by all her family and her new dog sister Lucky. She continued with this pleasant disposition throughout her whole life and many fun adventures to Pennsylvania and New Jersey. She was the first to greet our new daughter, Emma when she came home from the hospital at 3 days old. She became Emma’s friend and guardian, even gaining the nickname of “bathtime supervisor” Though Millie’s life was plagued by renal disease, she never changed her disposition or stopped wagging her tail. No matter how sick she was, we could always get a wag out of her by asking her if she was “hungry” Mille left us in a peaceful passing, where she entered dog heaven with her tail wagging, for sure. She was respectfully cremated at DeJohn’s Funeral Home with the same love we would have given her ourselves. Millie taught all those around her the true value of simply being happy, no matter the circumstances.

We found the cutest fluffy golden retriever/chow mix who was 8 weeks. He came right over to us and wanted to play, we fell in love and decided he was coming home with us. My husband Steve and son Josh fell in love him too as soon as he was home. We named him Rustee and did have him with us for 14yrs. Rustee was always picking when it came to treats. When u asked him to speak he would with a little bounce, so cute. He was an only child for many years til Spike our sheltie mix joined our family and then just a couple of years ago he also welcomed Harley our black lab mix. Rustee was a big licker when he greated you and he also took care of his lil brothers ears with the lick method. Rustee had been going through a hard time the last few years with his hip dysplasia and this year was the hardest for him. He always wanted to go out back and play with his brothers but as he walked he had some trouble. Any hard surface he would slip and fall down and lately it was really hard for him to get up on his own. We knew the day would come when we would have to let him go and relieve his pain. On Feb 4th this year he was having a hard time in the morning he didnt want to sit still and kept getting up and falling down. Steve was home with him that morning while I was at work and told me he was having a tough time. Rustee finally laid down in his spot in the living room to get comfortable and fell asleep, though it was his last most peaceful sleep. We miss him so dearly but we did have him for 14 awesome years and know we shall see eachother again in the next life. For now we know Rustee is painfree and looking down on us, we will always love and miss u dearly Rustee ol boy.

155,-1,Gina,Ross,gmross0814@yahoo.com,Euclid,Ohio,Fluffins McNugget,,"January 4, 2011",Best Cat Ever!,"Fluffins McNugget got his name as a small kitten. We brought him home from a friend's house where his mother gave birth to her litter in the garage. His 4 other litter-mates had found homes, and only Fluffins and his mother were left with my friend. He was such a mamma's boy that we were worried that he would be scared about leaving her, but the minute my son Steven, who was 9 at the time, picked him up, it was love at first sight. He curled up on his lap for the drive from Tremont to our home in Euclid, and his favorite human had been chosen. That evening, I brought home McDonald's as a treat for Steven, and little Fluffins, who was just a 10 week old ball of fuzz, went crazy over the smell of the Chicken McNuggets. He licked Steven's fingers and couldn't get enough. We jokingly started calling him Kitten McNugget and the name sort of stuck. He was a great cat. As he grew, he became very protective of his human family, sleeping on Steven's bed every night, and preferring anything that smelled of his humans for his daytime naps. About a year before his passing, Steven rescued a very young pregnant female cat from a bunch of dogs. She was starving and scared. We fed her and tried to find her owners, but were unsuccessful. McNugget befriended her, with no aggression or territorialism at all. When she had her two kittens, Peanut and Joe, he loved them too. Once the kittens became old enough that their mother would let them out of her sight, McNugget developed a very special relationship with the boy kitty, Joe. They would snuggle and groom each other endlessly. It was the sweetest thing I've ever seen. All 4 cats would play together, as if McNugget was the adopted father of the cat family. He was just that welcoming of everyone, feline or human.He became sick very suddenly, from unknown causes. His little kidneys just couldn't keep up, and we had to let him go after several weeks of veterinary visits and home care. It was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever done, but I know that it was the right thing to do. The services offered by Dejohn Funeral Home were very dignified and beautiful. We received McNugget's ashes in a beautiful wooden box with a velvet bag inside. The package came with a clay pawprint and a bag of his soft black fur that I miss so very much. It was very obvious that Dejohn takes their business of caring for departed companion animals as seriously as they take caring for humans. I don't regret spending the money for McNugget's cremation. It is what he deserved after all he gave to us. Goodbye my sweet furry friend. You were loved more than you know.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\155\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,0

He loved to ride in the car and looked forward to going to Ariel's dad's house when she was there.  Once he took a liking to a TY stuffed toy dog of Ariel's and would take it to the litter box and wait for it to go to the bathroom.  He would jump on the dryer and beg for treats and soon taught our others to do the same.  He seemed to smile at you when you looked at him. Each time I went by him I could not resist scooping him up in my arms and smelling him in his neck as he purred and loved me back...he always smelled like cotton candy.....I loved him so....He had a great life playing with Mya our cally cat...they would race across the house and flop down and play....when Gary came in the picture he accepted him too.  Tigger was a lover not a fighter. Tigger came to us in 2001 in Jan 2011 he got cancer. The hardest thing I had to do is decided that the best thing for his suffering was to put him down and watch Ariel hold him.......You couldn't tell us the pain you felt inside Miser Tigger LaBoski. People say get another.. there will never be another Miser Tigger LaBoski RIP my beloved little orange tabby you will live in our hearts forever.. Love Shelby, Joe, Ariel, Mya, Gary, Cindy, Lady bug, and Whiskey....we will see you at the Rainbow bridge...xoxoxo",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\156\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\156\story_pic2.jpg,,,,,,,,,-1

Lily was a birthday present from some friends that thought I needed more happiness in my life. She was only six weeks old and I fell in love with her from the the first moment I saw her. From day one we knew we were meant for each other. Through good times and bad she was always there. Lily made life easy to live and happy everyday. She was always by my side. For eleven years I woke up to her loving face and went to bed after telling about my about my day and let her know how she made it special. She was always there at the door to greet me and was happy. I did the best I could to give Lily and great, full life. I wish I could have done more for her in the end, but I know she passed peaceful. I am thankful that she was in the comfort of our home and I was holding her when she passed. Lily was a wonderful friend, and member of my family. She was loved by all who knew her. Lily will be remembered and very greatly missed. I Love you Lily.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\157\story_pic1.Jpg,,,,,,,,,,-1

While I was looking at all the other cats that came out and greeted me, she stayed in her cage with not even a shy look towards me. I asked the lady is she up for adoption and she said oh yes, but she is so shy that she has been return several times. Well that was it I took her home. Over the last month I laid on the floor with my arms under the bed where she stayed at so that she would smell my hand and get use to me. So one day after all the nights laying on the floor she was on the bed looking down at me. What a stinker. Love was there and she knew I would never take her back there. One day I knew she was home when I came in and had clean laundry in my laundry basket and there it was so sad to see, but I knew she was home was a little mouse, not harmed but yes dead, all curled up waiting for Daddy to come home and take care of this, since she was done with it. And another time when I would go to bed and yes she was in bed every night with her daddy. She would wake me up licking the back of my neck and would not stopped, oh it tickled soo. She was a loving, caring, one person kitty who knew she was loved by her daddy, witch I hope she will never forget me, ever. I did not want to let her go, but I knew it was time and she did as well. Missy's Dr. told me with a wonderful card that she was touched by Missy little white paws. She had the most dainty paws ever.

163,-1,"Stephanie, Carmen, Nieka, Kian, Kyle",DiGregorio,stephdig@comcast.net,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Lucky,,2-24-2011,Luckiest cat ever.,"Lucky was just about 8 weeks old when he strayed away from his mother who lived somewhere in the neighborhood who was also a stray. My 3 kids ages 12, 10, 5, were bound and determined to catch this stray wild cat and make him their own, he was very tiny. They tried and tried then finally caught him. They kept him inside one night and he cried all night, so we put him back outside so he could return to his mother we felt he still needed his Mom. So he ran off to find his mom. Well we were going camping for four days up in pecos about 2 hours away from Albuqueruqe, it poured rain the whole trip up there and the roads were bumpy and rocky and muddy. Well we finally go there and we were in the middle of cooking dinner when our dog spotted something under the truck up where the gas tank is. We thought he might have spotted a squirrel because there were lots of squirrels in pecos in june. So our kids started looking up under the truck to see what was there and they found Lucky very very scared. He had rode the whole time up under the truck. So we tried for over an hour to get him out from under the truck, Finally we got him out and my kids babied him for the next four days. We had to make him a makeshift sand box for him to use and we had to grinde up dog for him to eat because we didn't have any cat food. He grew to like it. So we all agreed we would take him to the shelter, but he never made it we ended up keeping him and having him fixed. We we noticed he started to walk funny and was in no way coordinated. He would fall down if he tried to jump and his back looked like a bowing horse. So we thought he had carbon monoxide poisoning from being under the truck for so long. He still ate good, drank good, so we just thought he was a little special (dope)we would just have to help him sometimes. He would lay in your arms upside down on his back for hours at a time, he would sleep on his back between my husband and I all night in bed covered up. My 5 year old would sit on the couch with lucky sitting upright in his lap for long periods of time watching cartoons. He fell in love with lucky, that was his cat. because he could hold him for hours without him running off or scratching him, he never even meowed he was a quiet cat. Lucky was special in every way, he was loved dearly by all of us. He was the sweetest cat ever. In februrary he fell limp and couldn't walk anymore and we didn't know why. We thought he might have an ear problem. So we took him to the vet and they tested him to see if he was paralyzed, but that wasn't the case. The vetrinarian took x-rays and found the his spinal colum was not formed at birth and there was nothing supporting his head and nothing covering his brain stem and his vertebrae in his back was not complete there were pieces missing and that is why his back bowed. So when he fell limp he had damaged his neck some how and the brain stem became swollen and thats why he couldn't move anymore. There was nothing we could do. We had to end his suffering. This was never going to get better. Our children were devestated because he was only nine months old. Our littles son still grieves often. I tell him that ""at least he was sent to us by God so he could be loved to the fullest for his short little life"" and that he was. He is our little angel. We love him and miss him very very very much every day. It is now gods turn to enjoy his presence. He will enjoy it.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\163\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\163\story_pic2.jpg,,,,,,,,,-1

166,-1,Stephen,Cannon,me@stephentcannon.com,Clearwater,Florida,Neighbors,,4/7/2011,Neighbors the Cat aka Mr. Neighbors,"It was 1996 and I was living in an apartment and there was this black stray cat hanging around the parking lot.  The neighborhood kids weren't all that kind to him, but I would still see him rubbing up against their legs, as if to tell him he knew they weren't all that bad.  He certainly didn't belong to anyone because he was always in the parking lot and he would be at a different door step every other morning, day, and night.  It was clear he was a stray both in his eyes and in his swagger throughout the complex.Whenever I would come home to my apartment and he was around he would purr and rub up against my leg.  I would talk to him like he was an old pal I hadn't seen in forever.  Always seemed to me that a true friend can be defined by someone you haven't seen in forever and a day, yet you pick up that last sentence you stopped right in the middle of the last time you said good bye to them.Finally, the day came, a few weeks later for me to move on.  I was packing and my front door was open most of the time.  That darned black cat kept coming into the apartment, getting into boxes, and getting into the moving truck.  I would toss him out, shoo him away, but couldn't help but to stop and pet him when he wasn't being an all around pest about it.  Well, when it came time to finally leave for good he just wouldn't budge.  He wouldn't leave, as if to say, let me come along too old friend.  So, he came along for the ride, for the adventure, to my new house.I didn't really know what to name him and when someone would ask, ""Whose cat is that?"" or ""Is that your cat?"" I would reply with ""No, that's the neighbors cats I suppose.""  So, the name ""Neighbors"" finally stuck with the little guy.  Later it would be Neighbors the Cat"" which later turned into ""Mr. Neighbors"" or just ""Neighbors"" for short most of the time.  Over the years, a lot of people thought he was named after the late Jim Nabors and would ask if I was a fan or something.  I always thought it was kind of odd that most people would jump to that conclusion and not see the obvious reason for his name.  I guess a lot of people must name their cats after famous deceased people or something.  Don't know myself.  Anyway, this always led to the Tale of Mr. Neighbors and how I came to know this unique little guy which always brought a little chuckle.Neighbors was never really a true house cat or pet kind of guy.  He always had that ""stray streak"" running through his blood.  He would disappear for days or weeks at a time.  Albeit sometimes he would just be accidentally locked in a closet because he never really meowed much.  That is until he got into his later years and would stare at the wall and meow at nothing, or at my bedroom door, for hours, to my dismay.   So, if he wanted inside or outside or anything else, you only knew because his Jedi Cat powers were no match for us mere mortal humans.  I don't know how many times I awoke to myself pouring him a small platter of milk or giving him other refrigerator treats, all the while wondering how I ended up in the kitchen in the middle of the night. He adored all of my children over the years.  He would sleep by them, eyes glowing in the night, never seeming to sleep, as if to be protecting them from some unknown menace in the night.  He would follow them around aimlessly or allow them to dress him up without harming a hair on their head.  Yet, he wasn't a fluffy duffy cat either and he would give you your own if you weren't careful.  If he wasn't wandering neighborhoods, killing small animals, battling other cats, and the having it out with the occasional rascally snake or driving the local dogs nuts, he was trying to stand on your chest to steal the warmth from you.  Damn he seemed to weigh a thousand pounds with bony feet like spears when he wanted.  Why is it cats can seem to weight nothing and then as much as a freight train a moment later?Like I said, he was a wandering stray.  Sure bet, I will get a lot of criticisms about how your cat should be kept inside, put on a leash, and all that jazz.  I agree.  To a point.  Tried it a few times.  Every time I did, it seemed to kill that beautiful stray spirit that coarsed strong and hard through his veins and that spark inside him seemed to dim the longer he was stuck in side.  Not sure if anything should be caged forever, specially something born wild or stray.So, over the years I had to accept that he might just wander away forever one day.  I had to grow accustomed that I might not know whatever happened to him.  More than once I thought I lost him forever, that he had gone off with another family, or died in the night alone, without being able to say good bye.I am sure he had dozens of families through the years wherever I moved.  I wonder how many of those cried themselves sick thinking he probably died, not knowing he just went back home.  Guess it might have been easier not knowing, like those other families he probably had.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Being able to pretend he hopped into someone else's moving truck and was living a different life.He seemed to always be at home no matter where he was and whoever was nearby was his companion. Yet, no matter how many times he disappeared for days or weeks on end I guess I wasn't prepared.  I wasn't prepared for him to be gone forever.  I thought I was prepared, but I am not, because this time he won't come strolling up like nothing happened weeks later with an open wound or a new scar or a chunk of his ear missing.  This time he won't fall out of a closet after having been gone missing for a week or longer.  This time I won't see him peering from the 3rd story roof after not having seen him in god knows how many days.  This time I won't get a call from some far off neighbor to come get my cat, after he has been shacked up at their house like it was Club Med for Cats for a couple months.  Not this time.  This time he went on without me on an adventure I can't accompany him on.  This time it is...forever.  Ever notice when forever shows up on our door stop we wish for only one thing?Just one more day. One more day to do the things we never did and say the things we never said.  We wish for more.  More.Then when we get through to the other side of that we notice what we appreciated and were grateful for and what we cherish and remember.Today.  Today, I am just glad he didn't just disappear into the dark of the night because in the end even the stray needs someone to see him through to the end.We love you Neighbors and you will always be missed.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic5.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic6.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic7.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic8.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic9.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\166\story_pic10.jpg,0

She had a brother named Jade.  He was Siamese.  She lived in a trailer the first few weeks of her life.  My brother and his wife adopted Sadie in 1994.  They lived together from 1994 to 2006. In late 2006 she came to live with my husband and I and our four cats. She was the elder in the house. But you never would have known it. She would lead the charge when it was time to eat, even if it was 2 in the morning. She learned a little trick as a youngster, how to slip her paw under doors and open them. So many times you would come home and not see her right off and there she would be in a closet snuggled in a basket of clothes. I made a seat on top of my sewing machine with pillows and a penguin rug.  Next to it was my cedar chest. It was in the sun.  That was her favorite place during the day. You could find her there sometimes alone or sometimes with one of the other kitties snuggled closely together.  They would either watch the cats that lived next door or drift asleep in the warm sun.Sadie had a heart of gold.  She was always concerned how our day was going.  At the end of the day she would lay next to us on the couch or climb the steps up to the top of the entertainment center and go to sleep in a little bed there.In 2006 she was diagnosed with CRF, Chronic Renal Failure.  But this did not get her down.  She realized soon after getting her Sub-Q fluids that they made her feel better. So in the mornings and the evenings when it was time you could find her patiently waiting on a little perch for them. Her beautiful Russian Blue “Grey” fur was only second to her emerald green eyes that would attract you to her.  Once anyone had the chance to get to know her they knew that had been honored. Sadie would climb into bed and lay by my head.  Sweetly watching me sleep till I would wake up and see her green eyes looking at me.  I miss her little meows throughout the house. The last days she was here she lay in the sun and still climbed her pet stairs to go wherever she wanted to go.  Then the Rainbow Bridge appeared and her time to go was soon to be.  But not without gracing me with three strokes of her soft nose on mine and a few soft meows.Our home is missing a little Russian Blue kitty now.  Our other cats look for her around corners or at the door.  She put her paw prints on all of us.  Someday we will all be together again but not until her delicate paws runs through the grass and in the sun on the other side of the Rainbow Bridge without CRF. We miss you Sadie Baby.  Our hearts have a hole in them.  A deep sadness is felt.  We shared a love that was deeply bonding whether here on this earth or beyond. ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic5.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic6.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\168\story_pic7.jpg,,,,0

She looked up at me with her huge brown eyes and I knew then she would be my baby!!! She showed me unconditional love from day one. She was a very active and happy dog.

He left me that first night, he was cold, I remember it was 18 degrees and I felt guilty for not taking him in out of the cold. But eventually he returned, still cold and hungry. He would not even get close enough to us to eat out of our hand. I knew I would not leave Virginia without him. I just had to convince Donna of the same. He made the long ride home with us, huddled behind the seat of our pickup, still scared and shaking. We originally thought we would find him a better home, one that was more suited for him. We didn't even want to know his name. As time passed, we realized that we were best suited for him, and he for us. He was still very scared, but was starting to find comfort in us anyway. My mother told us we didn't need him around, but I knew he needed us around. Our daughter would tolerate him, but in her eyes, she was the chosen one. He treated her with compassion anyway, and eventually she realized she had a lot to teach to him (and he to teach her although she would never admit it) He was suspicious of others his whole life. In a way it was perhaps a sign of how he would leave us. I don't blame him for not trusting others he did not know. He became an adopted son to Donna. Keeping her and Cassy company during the countless days I had to be away with work. He kept her safe from storms and intruders even though he himself was scared to death. He loved to exercise. Maybe it was a throwback to his life in the hills. As we found out later, this was just one more of the many gifts he was sent to give us. He was fast on his feet. We called him slick. As time went on, that boy from the hills of Virginia became a city boy. He learned the streets of Columbus, and became part of what looking back were simpler times. He would eat lunch with Donna every day and could barely contain himself when she returned home from work. A hand shake, a peck on the cheek, a kiss on the nose was all he wanted. The important stuff. The happy dances. He never cared too much for food. He would take his share, but rarely more. He loved Spaghetti and Salmon. Odd combination for a boy from Virginia. He traveled back with us to Virginia many times. Also on trips back home to Cleveland he broke the ice with my mother who eventually saw how great a soul he really was. He as not without fault. He could be destructive at times, I think maybe he had an inquisitive streak that would get him into trouble on occasion. That is probably what caused him to find us. In retrospect it was all harmless and inconsequential. It was funny sometimes how someone so timid could get himself into situations that required such bravery. Another of the lessons he taught us about living. He eventually made friends with a select few others. The lady that would look after him when we could not bring him along. He trusted her. He knew a natural when he saw one. My friend Mike who had little use for his type, and my brother who admired him greatly. Bruce could tell a good man. As one who was so mobile, he faced the biggest challenge of his life when a back injury left him paralyzed from the waist down. We were devastated. He did his best to take it in stride. That night was one of the most difficult for us together. I was also very sick that night and we both wound up in the emergency room. He met the challenge of back surgery head on, and after weeks of therapy and dogged determination he realized that he needed us as much as we needed him. He walked and ran again. He was never quite the same though, and we sheltered him slightly for the rest of his life. We tried to dress him up on occasion although he looked best in black white and tan. Perhaps the Woodstock costume was over the top, but it was all in good fun. He would greet the trick-or-treaters back in the simple life. As time passed and we moved up to our home in the country, There were no more trick-or-treaters, no more walks down the sidewalk . It was both a blessing and a curse for him. We had land of course, but because of the distance, Donna no longer had lunch with him. He would just sit and wait for her to get home for way too many hours. He and Cassy eventually became inseparable. Brother and Sister. They both waited patiently for our return. Hours would turn into passing days and days into weeks... one bid period at a time our life passes us by. He ultimately showed us how to rise above the self pity of one's past and live life with dignity and style. He eventually became more trusting of others, but not fully. It seemed he always remembered his roots, without perhaps embracing them. We never quite knew what happened to him before he brought us into his life. Maybe I don't want to know. I believe that is was not an accident that we crossed paths that day ten years ago. Some things are meant to be. We are not supposed to know why. He was the exemplification of class and dignity in the way he has lived his life. Letting others act ridiculous, he would just stand on the sidelines and watch and wait his turn. He loved emotion on your part, and would ask for more when he wanted it. But not expect it. Class to the end. We never actually new how old he was. We would always just celebrate his birthday on Valentines day because he was the love of our life and certainly angelic. In fact we just did celebrate his birthday last month. We could not have imagined it would be his last. That skinny little boy from the country... turned city that meant everything good and simple, will now be fighting a battle he cannot win. One he is too frail and slow to escape from, and one we will have to help him end. He was diagnosed with inoperable abdominal cancer. Pancreatic cancer that has spread to be exact. The words are hard to write. Hard to read The same disease that took my father. In two weeks it has taken him from vibrant to fragile, svelt to saggy. Strong to oh so weak. Palliative care is what they call it. End of life care. You do it. If not you then who? Who else would you want to do it? So you trudge on, watching his every move for signs good and bad. None of it matters. The end will come regardless of any sign. You just try to help him maintain that dignity that makes him unique. Its hard to wrap your brain around the concept of the whole life you have spent together. The good times and the tough times, all the while being there for each other, and the fact that it is all ending. You bounce from selfish thoughts of how you will miss him, to his suffering, and how he will miss you. His life is too short both for his sake and yours. You long for when life seemed endless, hours seemed inconsequential. Now when the end is near, seconds seem longer and so valuable you couldn't buy them for all the money you have. But its really not time now that you want to buy, it is time passed, time away, time before. What we are going through is not unique. There are people going through this all over. But he is unique. There is only one of him. One combination and culmination of all those things that came together to make him who he was. The snort, the snore, those long ears. In times of crisis, your world shrinks to tunnel vision. Things that seemed important before, don't now. You are focused on the crisis. Your world, not those poor people in Japan or on the local news. You and those close to you see the world from your personal perspective. I guess that's normal. I am sure the end is near for him. As a Pilot, I am used to making a plan and seeing it through. When it comes to inoperable cancer, there is no plan. You move slowly toward the end. I've noticed as you get older you start to see beginnings and ends to things that matter to you. People that matter to you. I think of it as ""Moments in time"". Lives lived and ended before you were around. Places that were there and are now gone. Times and events and daily life that was there and now gone. We live our life through ""Moments in Time"". Mostly we don't even know we are experiencing it until it is long passed. It's human nature to not know what you have until it's gone. Rare is the exception who can realize it is happening and embrace it. I'm sure that you have figured it out that this man that I am writing about. My ""Main Man"" as I call him is my dog, my best friend Willy. The little man with the big heart. A part of the fabric of our lives, he was sent to us to teach us those qualities that made him who he was. I will miss him. I will miss all that he stands for. All that he represents, all those good times. He cannot speak the words, but I am confident he will miss us as well. It is the belief of the after life that allows us to barely deal with the tragedy that we face. His spirit, his life force surely will live on. It has to. We need it to. I have mixed emotions about euthanasia. It can be convenient, if death is convenient. Why prolong the suffering? But when is enough enough? I have always dreaded this day. If you have dogs you know it will likely come. You dread it also. But you would not trade the life and times that lead up to it. I don't know what tomorrow holds except that it will be tougher than today. I know I will have to muster strength and fortitude that I don't know that I have. Selfishly, I dread the long drive and the empty car ride home. The cold hollow house with him not there. It will be like a picture frame you have looked at your whole life without the painting in it anymore. I am sure life will go on. It has to. I suppose the best gift we can give him is to cherish the memories with him...of him. He will be immortal in our minds. In our Moment in Time.

172,-1,Rick  and  Gail,Kirby,kirby1953@msn.com,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Arrow,,4/21/11,Our Tribute to Arrow,"Arrow was a black lab/chow mix. He was very much a people dog and went everywhere with us, even flying in our plane. He went to Lake Powell with us and his buddy Koty whom we lost four years ago June 1st. Then he got a rescue dog friend from DC four years ago named Cedar, a chocolate lab. So we've got one left with us and not sure we'll get anymore pets as it's just so hard to loose them.Arrow loved Christmas. It was one of his favorite times of the year. He actually knew which stocking was his and so did his brother Koty. They were great together. He really missed him when he was gone from our home. About six months ago Arrow had to have a growth removed from his behind close to his colon, it was Carcinoma. A few weeks back we noticed it had returned to the same place and scheduled a 2nd surgery to remove it. Dr. Jeff found it had attached itself to the colon this time and he was unable to save his life. Arrow would have been 14 in August and is greatly missed. He touched the lives of many and loved everyone he met. He was the most loving and sweetest dog we have ever had. We've both been beside ourselves since learning he could not be saved. We know he must have been in some pain of late as he started panting heavily, and more and more as the days went by. All we can say is he's probably with Koty in Heaven running and playing and one day maybe we'll see them again.Our love is always with you, Arrow, and we miss you so much!Dad and Mom",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\172\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\172\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\172\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\172\story_pic4.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\172\story_pic5.jpg,,,,,,0

Everything Buster did was with gusto.  He was a live in the moment kind of dog.  He thoroughly enjoyed whatever it was he was doing. Here are just a few of the nicknames he earned: Kramer(from Seinfeld) because of the way he would sometimes enter a room with a little slide.Tigger because of his bounce andBuster Love because love just oozed from him.  He was like your favorite cartoon character. If he saw a mud puddle he was going to have to run through it at least 3 times.  When Buster would get a hold of something he shouldn't have especially someones food it was going out the dog door.  I can't tell you how many sandwiches escaped the kitchen through his mouth and were enjoyed in the back yard.  We never were sure which dog was getting in the trash until my husband arrived home one day to find Buster with the trash can lid on his head. He brought a lot of laughter and cheer to our lives and to those who knew him.

We bonded strongly within a day or two, and were literally together every day for the next 11 years. The longest we were separated was for 3 days when I had to go out of town on business. He was with me at home, went to work with me, and I took him even when I ran daily errands. Most of all, we did fire investigations together, and he is directly responsible for discovering evidence used to send a lot of criminals to prison. Not only arsonists, but some of them murderers who tried to burn the crime scene. Winchester suddenly turned ill, and peacefully passed from the bonds of this earth on May 9th. Winchester was a loving soul who loved life as much or more than most people. He loved to just get out of the office to just walk; nowhere in particular, so long as I was walking with him. He was my work partner, my family's pet, but even more importantly at least to me, he was my friend. This was a loss felt by many people that knew this loving animal both at home and at work. He will forever be remembered and missed terribly. Farertheewell my faithful and trusted friend.

At that time, we had a Great Dane, a Rottweiller, and a German Shephard mix.  Right away, he stole a McDonalds cheeseburger, removed only the meat pattie and gave it to the Shephard, who was the oldest and wisest.  By doing that he sealed himself into our ""pack"".  Soon, the littlest guy thought he was running the pack and the others let him go ahead and think just that.  He would dangle from the lip of the Great Dane who would then give me a pleading look for help (which I did).  He and the Rotti would play ""sock"" with the Rotti lifting the seven pound Chihuahua off the ground from one end of my husband's sock, dipping him like a tea bag hanging from the other end.  He and the Shephard had a quiet understanding, you could tell they loved each other but mostly stayed out of each others way.  All the while, we spoiled him like crazy and he became ""my"" baby.  Every night he slept in our bed, cozying up to hear my heartbeat.Over the years and the loss of his brothers, he and I became more and more attached.  He would follow me around, sit at my feet, and generally be within the sound of my voice.  Sometimes, he would sit next to me in the very chair I am sitting in now.  I would scoop him up and put him behind me.  He would snooze while I typed until my back hurt from sitting forward to give him the room to sleep.  My God, it's as though I can still feel him there.Because we were always together, I truly did give him one hundred kisses a day.  Ten or fifteen smooches in rapid succession, several times over the course of a day.  On his head or on his cheek . . . he got kissed.Well, I wouldn't be here if the unimaginable, unthinkable, tied-for-first-place, nightmare of my life hadn't happened.  He's gone.  I was referred to Anderson-McQueen by my local SPCA for a private cremation and their compassion was tremendous.  In my grief, I wanted to see him for one last time and they arranged a private room for us to say our good-byes.  It was exactly what I needed.  Today, my husband picked up the urn that holds Bruisers ashes.  I took the oaken box out of the sack and gave it ten smooches in rapid succession.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\176\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,-1

I want to say we rescued her from a barn (where they were starting motorcycles up).  But I bought her from the people and it was the best thing I ever did. She was scared of loud sounds.  So I would take her on walks through our busy street to try and ease her of loud sounds.  It kinda worked she did not mind the car sounds anymore but then when thunder came that was different.  She was a great mother to 4 litters of puppies.  She never wanted to leave her babies and go out to do her business but that was when her old man would step up and go in the playpen or box and relieve her so she could go.  She was always playful with the babies.  We still have 2 of them which are now 6 years old and she was still being a mother to them trying to clean them and yell at them when they were doing something bad.When we lived in NJ (where we are from)she loved chasing snow balls. Did not like to catch them. But she would jump at the snowflakes when the were coming down.  She hated getting wet from the rain.  So if it was raining she would wait till it stopped before she would go out.She would always let you know when someone was coming down the street it did not matter if they were coming to you house or the nieghbors house whe would tell you.She loved spending time with you on the couch and watch tv with her head in your lap.  She was also a great co-pilot when we were traveling.  She loved her front seat.  She would share sometimes with the old man (West).  She was our Jennifer Anderson, Mommy, Memom.  She loved running in the yard at Mom-Moms.  She loved the Gulf of Mexico the water and the sand.  She was so happy when we got out own house she would tromp through it like ha ha this is mine and no one can take it from us.  LOL.  She had spots that were her spots.  She would always lay on Cookies side of the bed.  Which she made her own bed with covers to cover her up with.  She was the Queen of the house.On her last day with us. We knew something was wrong but we did not think it was her final day.  So we took her to Brandt Vet.  Her front seat ride. She was resting her chin in my hand the whole ride.  The vet looked at her and did some test.  We did not know it but she had a tumor that ruptured.  She was in shock.  She was bleeding internally. They said she was not suffering just in shock she did not understand what was happening.Jenny Rescue you are the greatest mother and friend anyone could have asked for.   We miss you so much.  We love you baby.Love Joan (mommy), Cookie, West (old man), Ascender  and  Kadan (her boys)",,,,,,,,,,,-1

Smokey was 19 years old and I was so fortunate to have been her ‘mom’ for 17 of those years. She deserved to have a feminine regal name, but the animal shelter, where we got her, said her name was Smokey… so we never changed it.She was so small and petite, dark grey with just a touch of white under her chin. She was gentle and loving and it seemed her purpose in life was to always be in my lap to cuddle and just have some part of her body touching mine. If I was late coming home, I would always find her in the living room window waiting patiently until she saw my car.One night I heard this loud growling, hissing and banging coming from the office. When I went to investigate, there was Smokey, all 7 pounds of her, defending our house from a large tomcat outside.She never looked her age and up until a week before I lost her she was still jumping with ease on any piece of furniture she wanted to. Her sister Cuddles misses her too. I know there will be other pets in my home in the future, but none can ever fill the hole in my heart that Smokey’s passing created.Rest in peace ‘my good girl”. Have fun playing with everyone in the beautiful meadow and remember one day we will meet again on Rainbow Bridge. ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\186\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\186\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\186\story_pic3.jpg,,,,,,,,-1
187,-1,Anne,Golembeski,agolembe@comcast.net,Albuquerque,New Mexico,Massimo da Brazzano,,20 September 2010,To Massimo: I Loved You Best,"Massimo was born in Brazzano de Cormons in the regione of Gorizia in Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Italy. His registered name was Giolly della Vallate. We were living in Italy and added this beautiful orange roan French Brittany to our family in May 2001. We were going to name him Maximus after the lead character in Gladiator but our Italian neighbors told us that was Roman and in Italiano it was Massimo, so Massimo he became. We called him Max and he was different from the beginning. We could not keep him in our yard. He would escape and go to Silvana's house where she would feed him good Italian cheese and bread. Our neighbors called him ""furbo,"" clever or sneaky in Italian, and was he ever! He could open doors and unzip suitcases. Nothing was safe around Massimo!Max once broke our Italian neighbor's dogs out of their yard and took off into the foothills of the Dolomiti mountains. We searched all day for i tre amici, the three friends, but could not find them. That night Max came home happy as could be but no sign of the neighbor's dogs. I was so devastated that they might not come back. The next day they showed up tired and dirty! Massimo once climbed a chicken wire fence by putting two feet on the wire and two on a thin little sapling tree. I tried to reach him before he made it over the fence. I'll never forget the look he gave me over his should when he realized I was closing in on him. He gave a mighty heave and dropped to the other side of the fence. He stopped, turned around and the look of victory on his face just enraged me! I grabbed my car keys because I knew he would head to the communal garbage cans down the road. I thought I had him cornered but he slipped away. I chased him through the narrow streets of my sleepy Italian village in my car, yelling and cursing. I'm sure the Italians thought I was a patzo Americana! Crazy American. Max danced away from me each time I cornered him and he slipped away with a look of triumph. Suddenly I realized we were on a busy highway and my heart stopped. Cars raced on that narrow and curvey road! I didn't know what to do except to pull off into a side road and chase him on foot. I looked in my rear view mirror and to my amazement little Max was chasing ME! I drove home and he ran after the car. I kept speeding up and speeding up as we drove up the hill. He kept running faster. Finally we reached the house and he threw himself into a small pond to cool off. I was so angry and so relieved. That was how it always was with Massimo! We moved to Albuquerque in 2003 and Massimo was so lonely for his Italian friends so we brought an American Brittany to our home to keep Max company. Valmont was a huge Brittany and Max quickly discovered Val could reach the counter. He used Val’s talent to pull a big container of Belgium dark chocolate off the counter. When we came home, Max and Val had chocolate all over their faces. Val was fine but Max had to make a trip to the emergency room to have his stomach pumped. In 2004 my father died and my husband and we dropped Max and Val at the kennel the day before I left for the funeral. A tech came to take big Val and little Max to the back. I noticed a door behind the counter open because it was hot. I asked the girl if she needed help and warned her Max was very sneaky and to be careful. She told us that it would be easier for her to control them after we left. As I was buckling my seat belt I looked out the car window to see Massimo trotting across the parking lot trailing his leash! I was horrified. Max was headed across a road that led to a subdivision. My husband and called to Massimo and he turned to look at us, his eyes alight with mischief and then he bolted towards the road. The tech reached the curb at the same time we did. I was absolutely horrified to see Max race across the road in front of a van. We screamed at the van to slow down but I swear it sped up. It was apparent Max could not beat the van and I could only watch and wait to see my dog crushed by the speeding van. The van closed on Massimo, no dog screams came to my ears, no dog body bounced up under the van. The van passed and there was no little body in the street…only Max’s little butt headed down into the subdivision. My husband found Max happily panting at a soccer field, resting after his escape. The tech cried on my shoulder and told us that Val had tripped her and Max had escaped. I was furious and relieved. That’s how it always was with Massimo!Massimo must have used up all his lives because in 2008 during a routine checkup the vet asked me if anyone had ever told me Massimo had a heart murmur. Since she had been Max’s vet since we arrived here the answer was NO. She told me Max had a stage 3 murmur and we should keep an eye on it. Max seemed fine to me until 2009 when the vet told us his heart was seriously enlarged. We started him on a bunch of medications and Massimo fought the good fight until 20 Sept 2010 when he told me he was tired and couldn’t fight anymore. Massimo will always live in my heart. He never complained even when I knew he was tired. He never missed a chance to hunt lizards with his best friend Valmont or bark at passing dogs. In Nov 2010 Valmont started going blind and was completely blind by Feb 2011. Val became ill on 5 Sept 2011 and died on 6 Sept, almost a year to the day that his best friend Massimo died. We miss them both and will always hold Massimo and Valmont in our hearts. They are chasing lizards over the rainbow bridge. Max's heart is strong and Val can see everything!  ",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\187\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\187\story_pic2.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\187\story_pic3.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\187\story_pic4.jpg,,,,,,,-1

Vlad, a lifelong Florida resident, was born in 2005. Early in his life he trained with an elite dog school. Upon graduating from le académie pour le canine, Vlad decided to reward himself by eating an entire couch.In addition to eating furniture, Vladdy Mandingo had many hobbies that he enjoyed, such as trying to kill small animals (especially the cat), eating cherry turnovers, going for “w-r-I-d-s”, chewing and listening to the song Rocket Man over and over again. Although he enjoyed many things, Vlad also disliked many things. Among the things he loathed were cats, strangers, carrots, cats, castration, bicycles, baths, cats and people of various ethnic origins. God forbid a Siamese cat ride up on a bicycle, scrub brush in hand, bearing gifts of baby carrots.During his lifetime, Vlad was always open and eager to try new things. Once Vlad decided to try putting his nose in his own poop. Afterwards, when he realized that this was probably not the best idea, the only way he could think of to get it off his face was to wipe it on his sleeping father’s face. Regardless, like the strong willed dog that he was, this experience did not deter him from trying other new things, such as tipping over the canoe, stealing food off the counter and spending a night in doggy jail for attacking a bicycle. Likely, he will be most remembered for creating a new dance he dubbed “Scratch Dance”. This particular dance requires one to prance in a circle while frantically scratching at the same time. Through trial and error, Vladdy finally found that the dance was best done on the hardwood floor at 3 in the morning while everyone in the house was trying to sleep.Despite being a little high maintenance, Vlad worked hard at his job of protecting his family. With Vlad by your side, you were always protected. He was an affectionate, good natured dog who loved unconditionally.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\189\story_pic1.JPG,,,,,,,,,,0

Boomer's first three years were spent in a very small cage and wasn't allowed to do much of anything outside of his box.  His owner eventually gave him to a rescue center when they lost complete interest in loving him, and he was put in a foster home until he could get a ""forever"" home.  In early 2004 I lost one of my cats, and grieved with my other cat and dachshund.  We missed our little furry friend terribly, and wanted to give a good home to another member in our cats' honour.  I went online to look for a new cat, but somehow stumbled on a website for a rescue site.  In a little picture on the left side - this little face appeared so sad, and so frail that I couldnt stop looking at it.  The foster home was a two hour drive, but I was compelled to at least go see this little dog.  I packed up my other dog and away we went to this home.  Boomer's foster parents knew we were coming and greeted us warmly.  Boomer, from what the foster parents told me, perked up like he had never done before.  He truly was excited to meet me and my other little companion.  That afternoon, Boomer came home with me to his new ""forever"" home.From 2004 to early 2011, Boomer had the most fun he has ever had! He got car rides, and Frosty Paws ice cream, he had a companionship with my other dachsund (Austin), and a new friend - a cat named Libby!  In March of 2011, Boomer his usual vet visit, but this time the vet found that Boomer had cancer, and immediately I took him to my local vet hospital for treatment.  He did great in his treatment and had a clean bill of health by May of 2011.  Sadly in early November of 2011, he took ill very quickly and I again rushed him to my vet hospital.  This time the diagnosis was grim as the cancer came back and had spread throughout his body (the hospital was shocked to see it back and so quickly).  I had to make a decision that I know in my heart was right, will mourn that choice forever.   Boo - you had more personality that a lot of people I know. You were my grocery bag inspector, my kitty round up guy - and protected me during my low moments.  You always had a tail wag for me no matter how you felt.  I love you, and will always love you and miss you. :(",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\190\story_pic1.JPG,,,,,,,,,,-1

Even though I was traveling every week and he was at work all day together we went out looking for a dog.  We were so lucky to be picked by a beautiful Boston Terrier.  Sticking with the “M” theme we named her Mugsy.  A few days after we brought her home she became ill, we decided that we would stick it out and pray she would get better.  I remember me and Mike on the kitchen floor rolling the ball back and forth playing monkey in the middle to make her thirsty so she would drink.  She pulled through and to call her an energetic puppy was an understatement!  We brought her to my parents for Sunday dinner and I could not find her, panicking we looked everywhere, outside in the back yard, in the neighbor’s yard, only to find her upstairs to young to figure out how to get down.Our family grew quickly and along came Michael.  We were so pleased that Mugsy was great with kids.  Michael would sit on his blanket and as Mugsy would come up to him Michael would stick his tongue out and Mugsy would lick it.  Soon Matthew came along.  Matthew loved feeding Mugsy, she would come up and lick the food right out of his hands. Mugsy was a great friend to Melissa.  She would sit while Melissa would brush her with the Barbie comb. The boys loved playing ball with her!  Every meal Mugsy would come sniffing and snorting for fallen food.  She would stand under my feet whenever I was in the kitchen just waiting for something to fall.  She loved to nap in the sun that shone through the windows, she would lay there and snore in the sun,The five of us were so blessed to have such a great dog in our lives.  I hope we brought her as much joy as she brought us.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\192\story_pic1.JPG,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\192\story_pic2.jpg,,,,,,,,,-1

It took us a few days to name him, but ended up calling him Oscar, since he looked a like Oscar the Grouch.  Needless to say, Oscar lived up to his name.  He was a little grumpy and very stubborn, but we loved him for it.  He didn't play unless he really felt like it. I'd throw the ball or his toy and if he didn't feel like it, he's just look away.  He was definately ""one of a kind"" pup. His long time girlfriend ""Foxy"" loved to play, but Oscar would only give her a few minutes, then he'd go back to doing his own thing.  Late 2009, we noticed he was losing weight and wouldn't jump up on the couch anymore.  After some tests, he was diagnosed with Cushings Disease in January 2010.  We stablized him for a long time with medication, but we knew it was taking a toll on him and wouldn't last forever.  Two years later, we noticed the meds weren't working anymore, he had a stoke and never really recovered.  Towards the end he was weak and confused.  I couldn't bare to see him that way anymore, so I decide it was time to set him free to play again, over Rainbow Bridge.

If either of us was not feeling well Maddie was close by to give comfort.She was a fiesty little thing, with a mind of her own.  There will never be another like her. She came to me on a hot summer day in July-a gift from God. On a cold snowy day in Feb. she lay peacefuly in my arms all morning, our hearts beating next to each other.  We knew it would be our last together.  She would occasionally give me a weak little lick,as if to ""I""ll be ok Mom, you be ok too"".  All too quickly the vet arrived and stopped her little heart and as she lay in my arms, my face next to hers she drew her last breath. Maddie girl, I miss you so much. Our house is empty, my arms are empty withour you.  You were so loved and I thank God every day for the time we had with you. Your spirit and memory will live in my heart forever.  Run pain free with joy. We will see you at the Rainbow Bridge.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\200\story_pic1.jpg,D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\200\story_pic2.jpg,,,,,,,,,-1

This was the day we brought Bella and Cody home from Lollypop Farm in Brockport.  Bella looked up at me with that one blue eye saying ""take me home"".  We had a short time with her but she gave us both so much love.  She was more human than most people I know.  She was/is our daughter and always will be.  She started with sezures around 3 years ago.  They started slow and the progressively became worse. She was then diagnosed with congestive heart failure and that is when they would last for 2-3 days.  My poor baby was suffering so much.  Then the final was when they saw what looked like cancer in her belly.  She was so young just 19 days shy of 7yrs old.  She was the most LOVING thing I have ever wrapped my arms around!  But her Daddy and I made a decision to not let her suffer anymore.  It was the worst day of my Life and I miss her more and more each day. The loss is the greatest I have ever felt and I have lost a lot of humans in my life.  WE LOVE YOU BELLY GIRL.  XOXOX Mommy and Daddy  Ginger made this easier we could not have imagined having anyone else but Harris taking care of our baby!

202,-1,Leee,Burgess,sleeburgess@hotmail.com,St. Petersburg,Florida,JASPER,,"March 9, 2012","A Magnificent, Beautiful Soul in Fur","We found Jasper in the woods while visiting Georgia in 2003. He was not neutered, matted, tick-infested, underweight and with no collar.  He seemed courageous and sweet and we knew we couldn't just leave him to the elements. Took him to the vet as soon as we returned home to find he had heart worms, no microchip and mats that required him to be completely shaved to the skin. This revealed dozens of tick-scars and that he was about 4-5 years old. We could see that he was relieved at the prospect of a new life with my husband, two children (6 and 9) and our Corgi, Clover.After looking like a greyhound for a few months, his wooly coat started to come in. He eventually looked like a glorious, movie-star Lassie. For a Collie he was exceptionally big and his elegant, dignified manner made him a huge hit with all who met him. He loved the outdoors more than anything, but occasionally would nap on our sofa. He was such a gentleman always, except when it came to cats and squirrels.  We added a 2 new friends over the past 3 years, CJ and Sky. Four completely different dogs just enhanced our lives. He loved policing the beach at Ft De Soto for overly active dogs. This past summer, Jasper began dragging his back leg. X-rays revealed spinal compression in the shoulder which was relieved by chiropractic. His legs very gradually became useless. Because of his age (14ish) surgery was out, but the vet said to keep him happy and pain free as long as possible. He continued to eat and be comfortable laying outside as always, but it was hard to watch such a magnificent animal not able to get around easily. On March 8th, I noticed that he didn't want to eat and his breathing was distressed. His expression, always so kind and intelligent, has gone distant. It was time. I took Jasper to Dr. P at Gateway Animal Hospital and stayed with him as he left this world, talking to him and thanking him for being with us for 9 wonderful years. He was a wonderful, magnificent dog. I cannot tell you how much my heart hurts right now, a week after the loss. I know he'll return to us in another body. A soul that beautiful is too good to leave forever.",D:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\202\story_pic1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,-1

She loved to go on car rides, go on walks (I think the beagle in her loved to follow her nose!), spend time with us (ear and belly rubs were her favorite) and sleep on our couch. She was happiest when she was with us no matter where that was.As she got older Shadow struggled with ear infections and had to have a hematoma removed from an ear.

I found her through a pet rescue called Mewtopia in Memphis, TN. They had just saved her from being euthanized by the city animal shelter. She had been at the shelter for 6 weeks which was unheard of for an adult cat! The day she was scheduled to be euthanized, Mewtopia saved her and a few days later, she was mine! I named her Angel because she surely had a guardian angel while at the shelter! She was a shy kitty. She loved being brushed! It was her favorite! She was afraid of litter boxes that had tops on them. She loved sleeping on my head. She was a true princess. She even drank water by dipping her paw in the bowl then licking it clean. And she was beautiful! She was a wonderful big sister to Brylie, Wallaby, kd, and Mr Mister. She is missed very much. I love you, Ange!",,,,,,,,,,,-1

He was saved by his breeder and when he got well, he was given to me. I gave him the name Keno because he was a ""lucky bird""!  He lived twenty years. Keno talked and cuddled and loved to make sweet sounds and even warned us of ""nearby danger"" as he ofter looked out his window into the woods! He suddenly became ill a few weeks back and it seems that they found an unremoveable tumor that would eventually end his life.His ""best friend"" was my African Grey, Winnie, who sat by his cage for a week, looking for and grieving for his pal.

They both were being put up at a local animal hospital until homes could be found for them.  Then my friend asked if I could put them up at my house as it was costing a fortune at the vet's. Well Camry wanted people but Clifford wanted to be off on his own. We found another barn for Clifford to go to. And of course I took Camry and our love story began.Today I lost my child and my best friend.

We were looking to adopt a dog and visited many places with no luck and had almost given up. Then at the last shelter and in the last cage, there you were! You had been abused and were very shy and reluctant to come home with us.We named you April not only because everybody thought that was your birth month but also because April is a time of beauty and freshness, like an April rain shower!It took a little time for you to trust everybody but soon you became one of our family. You were a very big part of our family.Over the years you never hesitated giving us your love and energy. You never turned down a bike ride, a walk, a run, a swim or any kind of activity. I remember many days playing for hours in the pool with the children. You learned many tricks especially catching a tennis ball. How can one dog have so much energy and so much love to give?There were days when things seemed gloomy but you were always there to brighten up that day.That is what I will miss the most. Everyone in our family could always count on you to make them feel better.A couple of years ago we noticed you were slowing down, but that was ok, you had earned it. Along with age came some blindness and weakness in your rear legs. I know that this was a disability but you couldn't tell, you never wanted anybody to feel sorry for you. Even through this all you wanted to do was to please everybody. That makes you a champion in my book. It is true, you were a man's best friend!Last week you told us in your own way that it was time to go to the Rainbow Bridge so you could play with Tabatha and all the other animals and friends. We wanted you to happy. It was perhaps the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. While being very sad and lost, It also makes our family happy thinking of you playing in the meadows and hills of the Rainbow bridge.Some day we will all be reunited on the Rainbow Bridge and swim,run, and play together. i look forward to that day!Rest in Peace Ole girl!Love your family,Mom, Dad, Amanda, Kyle, Matti, Claire and Molly",C:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\271\story_pic1.JPG,C:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\271\story_pic2.JPG,C:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\271\story_pic3.JPG,C:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\271\story_pic4.JPG,C:\inetpub\wwwroot\petpassages\images\story\271\story_pic5.JPG,,,,,,-1

After seeing the runt, Patches, we knew we were leaving with two precious little kittens. The orange tabby we named Pumpkin, and the pastel calico, Patches. Can you guess what time of year it was when we got them? October. My boys game them their names. Patches had been getting thin but she was still very active. We think it was her kidneys that gave out. She had trouble with infections but they always cleared up once the vet put her on antibiotics. I am convinced she knew because she found a quiet corner in the back of the basement and had curled up and went to sleep. My husband found her while doing laundry last night. We just saw her the night before and she was acting fine. Pumpkin stayed pretty close to me last night. I could tell he was confused and upset.

Perfectly aligned markings of black and white, and also 7 toes on his right front paw and 6 toes on his left. A very vocal little guy, whom I would refer to as ""My little prince"".  Chappy's antics never failed to make us laugh, and despite our short time together,the joy he brought to us cannot be measured.  There wasn't a day that went by where he wasn't purring, he truly was a happy soul. Our sincere gratitude goes out to him for filling our hearts with so much LOVE, and I am proud to say we told him that everyday of his life. He knew he was loved. The void we feel will never be refilled in the same way, he was special and will always remain that way. Little Chappy died very suddenly from a duodinal inversion, which is mainly asymptomatic; if there is any lesson to learn, it is always to let your loved ones know how much they mean to you, we did and that helps to heal the sorrow.
