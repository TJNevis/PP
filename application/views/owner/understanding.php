	<h2 class="page-title">Understand Secure Passages</h2>
<p>Secure Passages&#8482; is a strict identification, tracking and chain of custody procedure, which is designed to ensure your pet is cared for with the upmost respect, dignity, and security from the time your pet leaves your arms for the cremation to the time you receive your pet's cremated remains back. The following is an overview of our trademarked Secure Passages&#8482; procedure. The Secure Passages&#8482; procedure typically begins at the place of death; a Veterinary Hospital, your home and in some cases our facility.</p>

<h3>Identification &amp; Tracking:</h3>

<strong>STEP 1:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>At the time of your pet's passage, a five-part NCR document known as the "Secure
Passages&#8482 "document is generated. Each part is color coded, Top-white, 2nd-green,
3rd- yellow, 4th-pink, 5th-gold. This document serves several purposes: it contains the
pets and pet parent's information (identification), states the level of cremation service
requested, is an authorization for cremation, is a "Chain of Custody" document, and acts
as a contractual agreement. The "Secure Passages&#8482 " document will never leave your
pet in our Secure Passages&#8482 procedure as it acts as our First Level of Identification &
Tracking.</li>

<li>Affixed to the "Secure Passages&#8482" document is a stainless steel identification medallion
which includes a unique identification number specific to your pet. This unique
identification number is clearly stated on the "Secure Passages&#8482" document and is
instrumental in our "Secure Passages&#8482" identification and tracking procedure.</li>
</ul>

<strong>STEP 2:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your pet will be wrapped in a plastic shroud as this procedure will provide dignity
and respect to your pet while also being used as an additional means of identification.
The stainless steel medallion with the unique identification number on it is removed
from the "Secure Passages&#8482 " document and attached to the exterior of the shroud in
a very secure fashion. This is our Second Level of Identification & Tracking. ("Secure
Passages&#8482" document & identification medallion).</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEP 3:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the "Secure Passages&#8482" document and the identification medallion
accompanying your pet, a color-coded ID label containing the pet's and pet parents
identification information, animal hospital and level of cremation selected is adhered to
the outside of the plastic shroud. This is our Third Level of Identification & Tracking.</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEP 4:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to all the above, our Fourth Level of Identification & Tracking embraces
technology with our State-of-the-Art Pet Cremation Software "PCS", which has been
designed and created by Pet Passages exclusively for Pet Passages affiliates. Not only
is there a physical identification & tracking but there is also a duplicate of all above
information captured in our PCS. Our software can also inform you if you wish the
status of where your pet is within our care at any given moment. Our PCS was not only
designed for the crematory and veterinary hospital it was also designed with you the pet
parent in mind. Affording you the absolute most peace of mind that your pet is being
cared for with dignity, respect and professionalism.</li>
</ul>
<strong>"Chain of Custody"</strong>
<p>
This term is used when a deceased pet is transferred from one person/facility to another. We
follow a very strict "Chain of Custody" so that everyone knows where a deceased pet is at all
times.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon the pet parent and veterinarian signing the "Secure Passages&#8482" document, the pet
parent will have transferred custody of their pet to the veterinarian. The parent receives
the Gold copy of the "Secure Passages&#8482" document to retain for their records, and the
veterinarian retains the four remaining parts of the document. This is the First Level of
our Chain of Custody procedure.</li>

<li>Upon our staff's arrival to the animal hospital, the veterinarian will transfer custody of
your pet into our care, and both parties will sign the "Secure Passages&#8482" document.
The veterinarian will retain the Pink copy of the "Secure PassagesF" document for their
records, while the rest of the document remains with your pet (as described in step 1
above), and both your pet and the document are transferred to our facility.</li>

<li>During cremation the "Secure Passages&#8482" document is placed on the exterior of the
cremation unit while the Color Coded ID Label and identification medallion stay with
your pet during the cremation process.</li>

<li>After cremation, only the identification medallion and your pets cremated remains remain
and are cross checked with the "Secure Passages&#8482" document which remained attached
to the outside of the cremation unit.</li>

<li>Your pet's cremated remains and identification medallion are placed in an urn along with
the "Secure Passages&#8482" document. If you or the animal hospital receives the urn from
our staff, then the remaining three parts of the "Secure Passages&#8482" document are signed
by both the receiving party and our staff. Yellow and green copies go to the receiving
party and the white copy will be retained by our staff. Chain of Custody is complete.</li>

<li>If the veterinarian receives the urn from us, he/she will transfer custody of the pet's urn
to the pet owner, with each signing the remaining yellow and green copy of the form and
with the veterinarian retaining the yellow copy and you the pet parent will keep the green
copy. Chain of Custody is complete.</li>
